No paid courses, no groups, no bs. I‚Äôm working on my general store, I find it gives better a better chance for sales, rather than one product stores which are ‚Äúgambling‚Äù imo You could create two shops and see what works for you. Have a general store to sell whatever is trending and also create a niche store. I think a pet store primarily focused on dogs could do really well. You can always drop whatever doesn't work. Or gut it and try out different niches until you find a groove. Good luck!!",2025-01-19 18:57:39

Learn from your mistakes. Good luck. I would post the hell out of that north face coat on social media it is soooooo cute I would buy one right now if I had a dog I think your shop has so much potential, I would take away some stuff from your landing page so it's less busy. Also stop paying Zendrop, you can find plenty of pet products that go with your store using a free account with them. I'd give it more time, 12 sales in three months is nothing to scoff at in my opinionü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è good luck!! Yeah, close it Really I‚Äôm surprised you got 1 with this ugly color scheme. I closed it in 1 second. Your bounce rate must‚Äôve been god awful Please, as much as this helps their loved ones, the reviews are very fake. I saw it the second i read it. I thought so! But I appreciate your honesty, I will work on it. How are you marketing it? How are you getting sales? Words like ‚ÄúTop Grade‚Äù or ‚Äúpremium‚Äù are a turn-off. Bro your website is not that bad, i have been I to dropship since October 2024 and what I can tell is that you will have take more time learning marketing strategy, buy the product that you sell, do your own Creative, market it, learn SEO, learn algorithms of Meta and Google, Keep learning on the why üöÄ

Also very important, protect all your account with 2FA because in dropshipping there is a lot of Hacking on Facebook Meta business platform/ insta, Shopify etc protect everything, put a second person account to secure it too üîêüîêüîê INSTEAD OF CLOSING FOCUS ON IMPROVING YOUR PAGE .my ig is iwillgobylotsandlotsofnames I personally think it would not be a good idea to:
- start the first dropshipping store selling both dog and cat products at the same time
- import too many products to a store that is not UI/UX optimized
- selling many items under 20 USD without bundle deals or anything to increase AOV Can someone tell me what can I improve in my store? www.alunara369.store What's awful about it? It would be helpful to specify. Thank you I second this, a Northface dog coat could sell like hot cakes. Test different ad creatives on different socials and I bet one of them will hit for this product. I also think your domain name is clever, I hope you keep tryingüëè Thanksss.   Decided I kept on changing, I think this is the ugliest colour I have used Yes.  I will definitely try something else Well for starters it needs to work Is my webpage not opening for anyone? The black border around the cards is a bit much. On a whole it's really not that bad. Some good products in there, they seem reasonably priced and my wife would almost certainly buy half of it for our new puppy. 

OP, where are you advertising your site and on what social channels? If you do try something else in the future‚Äîthrow in the bin everything you think you know about ‚Äòdropshipping‚Äô and instead educate yourself on ‚Äòbusiness‚Äô next time. 

This store reeks of reading some dropbros ‚Äòfully sick dropshipping playbook‚Äô. And it commits alllllll the sins. Can you check again No It works and your store looks terrible. I can‚Äôt even look at it for too long. What are you? 13? Can you check it again Its for a young audience... But why? Good If you landed on this store would you buy anything from it?

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* I recommend using DSers with AliExpress and here's why
https://youtu.be/Ote0twG4Wlo?si=Zku7mCUeLi0bU-Nj

I've been using this setup for the past 4 years and truly believe it's the best setup for beginners

I have plenty of videos that goes through DSers and AliExpress so enjoy.

I always recommend reading Trustpilot reviews for companies you want to work with. Make sure to read their positive and negative reviews. If Youtubers recommend AutoDS, be sure it's either a sponsored video or the video description contains an affiliate link It depends on your needs. For dropshipping, Shopify is solid for ease of use and scalability. Tools like DSers or Spocket are great for product sourcing. Platforms like AutoDS are okay but can feel overwhelming or overhyped.

Avoid platforms with poor reviews or ones that overpromise quick results. You want something that helps you focus on building, not troubleshooting. Btw, if you want a ready-to-launch setup, check Ecomency ‚Äì they simplify everything. Just my 2 cents. I‚Äôm going to throw you a curveball. Drop this idea of being led to building a business around some shitty platform and first look to the market to come up with your business idea. Once you have an idea in mind, start looking into how you‚Äôll source your product/s. 

The dropshippers who are most likely to succeed aren‚Äôt going to be sourcing from these run of the mill platforms where a gazillion other ambitious bros are connected in and selling the same junk, the same way, to the same fatigued and wised-up customers. They‚Äôre going to be going to real and legit suppliers and distributors in their markets and teeing up real and legit relationships. 

I had an idea years ago to be the ‚Äòone stop shop‚Äô for all things hiking food. The store was to be content led‚Äîfood is an after thought for most hiking gear retailers and they don‚Äôt actively market it but it‚Äôs a product category that lends itself to content. Part of this was to sell dehydrators and food dehydration gear too. I reached out to all the top brands in that category and they loved the idea and wound be willing to dropship for me‚Äîthey already sell DTC so it‚Äôs easy to accomodate it. 

The moral of this story though is I had a defensible and competitive retail strategy. If I was some dopey bro who was like ‚ÄòI want to dropship your stuff and sell it with ads‚Äô I‚Äôm not offering up anything to drive incremental sales growth for them so they‚Äôd probably tell me to buzz off. Thanks!

I'm actually looking up your videos right now and think they're informative. But some steps feel like you're assuming the watcher already has prior knowledge like brand design or Photoshop. But I haven't dived deeper so maybe you actually have videos that teach these things or I could just learn them elsewhere which is also fine.

Nonetheless, I'll continue looking at your playlist since it's free and no links to any paid courses/communities so it's just a pure learning experience. IMO Spocket seems like it's just DSers with a better UI/UX. If it was free I'd use it but I don't see the price being justified. What do you like about it? What do you think of spytrends in comparison with spocket and dsers You're welcome, yeah in some videos I also forget to mention some points but it's because I mention them in other videos so I find myself having to repeat myself. I do have a video on some of the skills you should develop and ofc my 2 hour course which actually goes through branding and how to design everything from logo to the store to choosing colors etc.

But yes no paid groups or courses, everything free on my channel so enjoy! Glad you're getting through the playlist",2025-01-19 07:36:25

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* This is all about risk management. You could start on a ‚Äòhobby‚Äô basis and then formalise if you get traction but your government may take a dim view of this and you could get in trouble. Are you prepared to commit a federal crime, as minor as it may seem?

That all said, get your info from the OFFICIAL government sources on this. Don‚Äôt rely on some small-government ‚Äúthey can‚Äôt tell me what to do‚Äù bros on Reddit. 

Me, I don‚Äôt start half-assed businesses. If I‚Äôm going to start a business I do it properly. When I started my brand I registered a Pty Ltd company (the AU equivalent of an LLC) and did it properly. Here in AU if your business is forecast to do $75K over a 12 month period you need to register for and collect GST and file quarterly with the tax office. I ended up doing this from day-dot as after launch I was forecast to exceed this. 

I wasn‚Äôt setting out to throw spaghetti against the wall to see if it stuck; I was setting out to create a real business and that required formality and investment. You reap what you sow, as they say. You really should at least register as a business. In most countries it's cheap. You do not need to go through all of that at the beginning. I‚Äôm not sure of the ‚Äútechnical‚Äù correct answer but you‚Äôll be fine.

I would suggest going that route once you become profitable or are at least doing consistent revenue.

Shopify doesn‚Äôt take care of taxes. They can ~assist~ in some aspects but you‚Äôll still need a CPA (or however you typically file your taxes) Not at all, there is something which in legal terms is called ‚Äútaxing ceiling‚Äù which covers you (most of the time) and what it basically means is that it differentiates actual business apart from basic economical actions. 

To be even more specific, let‚Äôs take Ebay as an example. In most of the cases, you won‚Äôt even bother paying taxes for the items you sell there even tho legally, you are enterprising an economical action, but it is considered that it‚Äôs not a consistent revenue.

Hope that was clear! Oh ok! I think I understand now. But if I'm dropshipping it's not the same as reselling right? I'm selling new. Not the same, yeah.",2025-01-18 13:42:02

But from experience, I can launch a branded dropshipping store in like 4 days How successful was your store? Just shy of a $1M (AUD) in top-line over 4 years on a 50-60% GM. As a side hustle. Sold it last year‚ÄîI have a busy day job in e-commerce for a large retail business so the juggle became too much. Are you fully self taught? That‚Äôs awesome! Congratulations! I‚Äôm putting my head down and trying to research everything on marketing and e-commerce that I can. Which aspect of it is the most crucial? Im self teaching and want to avoid mistakes where I can but also learn what is the best method in practice, what to hone in on. And what you did sounds impressive, so any tips I can get. sorry to be one of those pests but access to real people who dont want to sell you courses is rare. Ish. When I was a teen I liked to sell stuff on eBay, fiddle around with blogs, and do affiliate marketing (when it wasn‚Äôt scammy AF‚Äîback then it simply mean putting ads on your site and getting a clip of the ticket). I then started my career in sales before moving into copywriting (I was a copywriter then editor of a popular blog for a retail business), then digital marketing (more retail, a little bit of DTC), then e-commerce (worked my way up to senior level e-comm leadership for a large global retail company). 

I did start a marketing degree early on but ditched it. I‚Äôm not a uni person. So, self-taught insofar as that‚Äôs how I broke into my professional career. But I have a strong background that led me to starting a business. 

Do I believe that ‚Äòanyone can start a success e-commerce business‚Äô? No. I think you have to have the right attitude, sufficient smarts, resilience, a get-shit-done and figure-shit-out attitude, and be willing to learn. Very few of the ‚Äòwhere I start?‚Äô types in groups like this will succeed if that‚Äôs their approach and attitude. Read:

My overall impression is that the amount of people that are fine with tax fraud, selling replicas/fakes etc is also going up, probably as a result of the same thing.  
Its always facinating when people get upset and really defensive about pointing out how their great money saving method is literally just crime.

There has always been lazy people, unprepared people etc, but they did not used to be (or atleast feel like they were) as large a portion of the overall community.

dropship,"starting), I‚Äôd love your honest feedback:"," make dropshipping more streamlined, especially for people who are just starting out or feel stuck spending too much time managing everything manually.

So, if you‚Äôre a dropshipper (or thinking about starting), I‚Äôd love your honest feedback:
**- Would this solve any pain points you currently have?**
**- Which feature sounds the most useful to you?**
**- Is there something you‚Äôd add or remove?**

I know how overwhelming it can be to juggle product research, managing ads, and setting up a store while trying to stay profitable, so I set out to create a tool that brings all of these tasks together.

Here‚Äôs what the app would include:
**- Trending Product Finder:** Discover trending and in-demand products with insights like search volume, seasonal trends, (powered by data similar to google trends). You can also import products directly to your Shopify store with SEO-optimized descriptions, titles, and images‚Äîall in one click.

**- Ad Creation Tool with Performance Tracking:** Generate ad campaigns for TikTok, Google Ads, and Facebook with optimized settings tailored for success. Plus, track your ad performance with a built-in dashboard and actionable insights to help improve your ROI.

**- Cross-Sell/Upsell Suggestions:** Get upsell/cross-sell recommendations for your products and how to bundle them to increase your average order value.

My goal is to make dropshipping more streamlined, especially for people who are just starting out or feel stuck spending too much time managing everything manually.

So, if you‚Äôre a dropshipper (or thinking about starting), I‚Äôd love your honest feedback:
**- Would this solve any pain points you currently have?**
**- Which feature sounds the most useful to you?**
**- Is there something you‚Äôd add or remove?**

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* This is a solid idea! Managing product research, ads, and the store itself can be overwhelming, especially for those just starting out. Bringing everything into one app could really save a lot of time and energy. I especially like the concept of a trending product finder and the ad performance tracking‚Äîit sounds like it could make decision-making a lot easier for dropshippers.

A few questions I have:

* How will you ensure the trending product data stays relevant, especially with fast-changing market trends? Are you planning to update that feature frequently or incorporate real-time data?
* For the ad creation tool, will it be customizable, or will it mainly provide default settings based on the platform? Some flexibility could be helpful for different niches.
* Would the app be free to download and use? 

Also, the cross-sell/upsell feature sounds huge. How are you planning to integrate that with Shopify or other platforms? Is it going to be automated, or will users have to input specific recommendations?

I think this could be a game-changer for beginners who are overwhelmed by all the manual work. I‚Äôd be really interested to see how this evolves! It sounds awesome! What stage of creation are you in? First of all, I truly appreciate your feedback, it means a lot! Let me address your questions one by one:

1- Trending Products: The data will be similar to Google Trends, focusing on what products people are searching for weekly, combined with insights from social media trends. We‚Äôll be incorporating this both manually and through automation to ensure that the results are highly relevant and accurate. The automation will fetch trending product data while the manual aspect will help refine and verify the results for better precision.

2- Ad Creation Tool: The tool will generate optimized ad settings based on the product, target audience, and niche. You‚Äôll also have the flexibility to customize these settings according to your needs and preferences before creating and launching the ad directly from the app. This way, it‚Äôs not just automated, it‚Äôs adaptable to your strategy.

3- Pricing: The app will follow a freemium model, meaning some features will be free while others will require a subscription. That said, affordability is key to me, I want to make it accessible for everyone. The price point will likely max out at $25/month, but I‚Äôm still finalizing the details to make sure the value justifies the cost.

4- Cross-Sell/Upsell Tool: This feature will allow you to pick a product from your store (or even one outside of it) and get cross-sell and upsell suggestions. You‚Äôll be able to import these suggestions directly to your store with optimized listings, tailored to whether they‚Äôre an upsell or cross-sell. I‚Äôm still refining how this feature will be fully implemented, but the goal is to make it as seamless as possible.

As for the development stage, he trending product feature and ad creation tool are nearly complete, I‚Äôm just finalizing the details. The cross-sell/upsell tool is next in line for development, and the landing page is already live. If you‚Äôre interested, you can sign up for the waitlist to be part of the beta testing phase

Again thanks alot for your feedback! Yeah, this sounds really cool! :)",2025-01-15 09:16:53

Can‚Äôt speak on META ads because i have never used them but if you let the algorithm learn a bit more it will probably yield better results A 4-day data sample is actually not quite enough for Facebook Ads, as the LEARNING phase of Facebook Ads requires roughly 50 conversions, after which the ad results will be smoother and stable. If your scale up for now, the odds are less than ideal.

Also, I don't know what type of ad account you are using, but generally credit card account ads run for about 7 days and will start boosting. So it is recommended that you do two main attempts during this period, 1) make more selections along the products that you are now testing with results, and 2) try to open a new ad account to do more test if you desperate for testing, lol Good stuff dude, honestly you can't do much with the ads but wait for the ad spend limit to increase. 

Here's a flowchart on how to test and scale
https://youtu.be/Ffs4tAQztxM?si=oScOjyIAWU9EYMO_

Here are all the rolls I played when dropshipping so you can get a few ideas on what to do 
https://youtu.be/4WW7uxTyDXE?si=IUgxFPs5gWhCCdfu

Create content for organic reach. Create blogs. Create automated flows. Create more ads creatives. Many different tasks to do. Add more products etc. Fantastic work, by the way, on getting your test campaign up and generating profits in only four days! Keep a close watch on this campaign, as its daily ad spend limit stands at 50 bucks, along with these considerations:

Find the highest-performing ad and audience, informing future planning decisions.

If possible, let loose with a secondary campaign that features fresh audiences or creatives.

Prepare further creatives so you can deploy them once you have budgetary decision points for scale.

Do not implement any more radical changes in a short span: let the current campaign run its course and prep for the scaling.

Hope this helps you Thank you! I have a few more creatives ready to go Im just waiting for my ad spend limit to increase before I start another campaign otherwise both campaigns are gonna be sharing the 50 dollars.",2025-01-13 23:48:14

https://youtu.be/_5evV83CS-4?si=3_osPInvVApycxD5

12 things I wish I knew before running ads
https://youtu.be/EoGY-mRdoY8?si=rEvdvJ9m7TRlbdJn

For many choosing the right fulfilment app as people tend to start with AutoDS because of all the YouTube gurus promoting it but it's actually a pretty bad app. Here's why
https://youtu.be/PSOkmzjmWRc?si=KdrLSYu42oYib_uP I wish I knew all the dropship platforms like Zendrop and Spocket are simply additional middlemen that are more of a scam than anything else. I would have succeeded faster by avoiding these suppliers. I wrote poor reviews about many of these platforms on my website Dropshipping Hustle. I should have stayed as far away as possible from Auto DS I shouldn‚Äôt have focus on meta ads only Most payment platforms do not allow you to run a dropshipping business or process transactions through them. How big of a cock I have Atleast half the industry makes their money selling beginners their course or bad information Sourcing and its importance would anyone care to share some knowledge about dropshipping? Any info is helpful for some someone that never done it.. This! And coming up with a worthwhile, sustainable, and compelling product idea and/or value proposition for your customer is the hard bit. You mean the actual operating a business part. Fulfillment of orders is the dropshipping bit of it.

‚ÄúIs drop shipping still profitable?‚Äù Thats how you can tell that someone doesn‚Äôt get it.  Is opening a business profitable? It can be. Is everyone profitable that opens a business? Not even close. 

It‚Äôs no different. It‚Äôs no get rich quick scheme. Most businesses are lucky to break even year 1. 

That said, I‚Äôm sure there are outliers out there like in every other aspect of life. It‚Äôs better to be lucky than good. Wow this is an amazing response. I was sitting here thinking of something - you nailed it Dropshipping from AE to eBay is not sustainable. You are one customer complaint away from getting flagged. Been there. I've heard the same thing. I've heard many youtubers saying they're essential, but normal people saying they're a scam. All that means is they pay youtubers to endorse them. I'm gonna stay away from them fs What suppliers should we use? Thank you sm, I was starting to wonder if I was missing out. Why is that? Can u tell me why? Like what dont u like abt the platform? yeah bro autoDS is the most scammy shit Do you also run ads on other platforms aswell or do you just do organic dropshipping? Covknmaxing They are not even in the dropshipping industry, they are course/affiliate marketers. Can you elaborate? Depends on the type of Dropshipping you're doing but if you're Dropshipping from China I use AliExpress but I only work with suppliers who I can utilise VIP links. I only use AE and nothing else.

Sell enough and then deal with the actual merchant on AE for discounts and packaging for your items. I run ads on other platforms what platform do you see the most success on? What platform is the best for you? I would say Google ads and classified Classified ads You also do Dropshipping? In local newspapers? Yes and I only run in Meta, I wanted to start running ads on Pinterest too but still not doing it üòÇ No Why are you not doing it What are you selling in your store ?

You need good product,  and know how to market it. But everything needs to look legit, basically he handles customer service,  returns, and etc. not with that attitude Yes, it is just saturated and you need to understand what you‚Äôre doing. But it will never not be profitable I started dropshipping on eBay last month and I've made a profit so yes it's still profitable. There‚Äôs always going to be product to source and sell that will be profitable, otherwise WalMart and Amazon would be broke. Sales will always be profitable. Absolutely Very very rarely This! 

Though, it looks like this is the one comment u/L7W- might have missed or glossed over! üò¨üòÇ

The tone of the question suggests the OP thinks of dropshipping as some sort of fleeting trend. The trend of selling junk through a junk website and hoping for riches has sailed‚Äîthough, it never really was much of a thing as the Lambo bros made out; they just wanted to sell courses. 

The real question here is ‚Äòcan you start a profitable _business_ in 2025?‚Äô The answer is of course yes. There‚Äôll be many great, profitable businesses started this year. But, equally, there‚Äôll be many that fail spectacularly and plunge their owners into all sorts of financial distress. Fair response üëçüèº Appreciate the comment How do you start?? I keep seeing this tik toks and insta reels but I‚Äôm just curious cause I wanna get into drop shipping i literally just started this week i made an instagram and tiktok account. my instagram account is getting good views for me just making it, my tiktok isn‚Äôt doing well, the algorithm isn‚Äôt picking up my content. do you have any tips on how to get your first sale? What products are you selling if you don‚Äôt mind me asking? 'A platform with less competition' what do you mean by that? Like platform to find products? Or platform to sell like shopify? thank you for the thought out response. i am selling right now on amazon but want to transition more to a dropshipping model. quick question- how would i coordinate sending property shipping info if they order two products from the store? would they get two separate packages ? From suits? Surely this isn‚Äôt sustainable? Was just a question bud, no need to get your knickers in a twist Slight contradiction there Drop shipping what if I may ask? Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôve read and even upvoted his comment! And not entirely sure where you‚Äôve got the idea I believe it‚Äôs a fleeting trend? It was just a genuine question on if drop shipping was still profitable considering how saturated it is. Yes, they get two packages. As long as you tell your customers it will be coming in two orders they're normally ok about it. Tell them your products are produced in different areas or you have multiple warehouses or something like that. why not? Everyone wears a suit. Also, he has his own niche where he targets African Americans and Orthodox jews. He makes a lot of sales from Google Ads, Organically, repeat customers, and from his mailing list. Not saying it in a bad way, but this question is literally daily in this subreddit and I respond with the same thing every opportunity I get, keeping it plain and simple Everything and anything! 

The key is to find winning/trending/in-demand products. Well you‚Äôre asking whether it‚Äôs profitable this year as opposed to last year or the year before. Sound businesses can be infinitely profitable. 

As for ‚Äòsaturation‚Äô‚Äîavoid it completely. Playing in the red ocean is only a good idea if you have a kick arse defensible competitive strategy (then, really, you‚Äôve moved back into the blue ocean) and you‚Äôre smarter, more flush with capital, more strategic, more well connected and experienced, and harder working than your competition. 

Remember, as the other bloke touched on, dropshipping is merely a distribution/inventory tactic. You‚Äôre creating a RETAIL business. i‚Äôm going to try to find a company in china who can package them together. ideally we want branded boxes also I just meant surely it isn‚Äôt sustainable as the average man will only have 1-3 suits, and unless they ruin them I can‚Äôt imagine them buying a new suit every other week. But that‚Äôs just my take on it ‚ÄòNot with that attitude‚Äô is implying you are saying it in a bad day, and if you‚Äôre fed up of seeing the question leave the subreddit, or simply don‚Äôt respond. Use your time better. Well of course, but if you compare 5 years ago to now, the percentage of ROI was definitely a lot higher than currently. Now what separates you from others is how unique your product is, the demand for it, how good your advertisement is, and how reliable you are. I am... not mad?  
Stop for a moment and see it as a wake up call, the moment you doubt something you're gonna fail miserably, I can get deeper into this but as I said, I'm keeping it plain and simple as community service and frankly I don't care if people dislike me for it If you clearly go out of your way to comment that on every post you see it would suggest that something in the back of your mind is clicking.. I don't see it as ""Ugh!, they're so stupid, always the same thing!"" but as ""damn, another one, lemme try to bring them to sense""  
What's clicking my mind is how pesimistic these posts are and not how it's spam, that's why I have the urge to comment that everytime I see one Hardly pessimistic and spam, when on every post related to this one, someone has a different idea or input on how to scale an online business or how to get started.

My question to you is could you do something that‚Äôs desirable and compelling to customers using a dropship distribution model? Understanding that in the fashion space you‚Äôre going to have a gazillion quality competitors who offer fast shipping and so on. 

Generally speaking, I don‚Äôt think dropshipping is wise for fashion. Unless you use it to compliment your core offering‚Äîe.g. you dropship a particular high ticket cashmere coat so you don‚Äôt have to outlay a heap of capital on something that accounts for 0.001% of your product sales mix. 

As a customer, I have the gazillion aforementioned competitors to choose from who are established and reputable and offer fast delivery. The only reason I‚Äôd shift from shopping with one of them is if you did something supremely distinctive or different or unique and I have no choice but to fold. Unless it's print on demand, I dont know how you could possibly dropship your own brand. Why not plan to ship yourself and order branded inventory? It seems like two separate business models you're trying to combine. We can offer small - batch clothing customization services. Let us know what kind of clothing you need. As for T - shirts, we have a wide variety of types. If this is on the dropshipping side you can perhaps get a manufaturer to create it exactly how you want it maybe on alibaba ( dont know about quality I just saw a video on it ) and their are other choices but this is for if you want to handle material and everything about how it looks .

If you want to just have a logo or a graphic you can go for Printify, Redbubble they make the shirts any you get a portion of the profit if they sell it on the website . By portion its up to you to charge. It's definitely possible to do! I currently run a Shopify store containing over 170+ uniquely designed POD (Print On Demand) products and have made over ¬£1.8K in sales and over ¬£700 in pure profit and I haven't spent a dime on ADs. As someone who has grown several clothing brands to 5+ figures monthly, I can tell you that clothing is fucking hard to sell, and the margins are thin, especially if you're starting with print on demand, which you are. 

I recommend starting with a product that solves a legitimate problem that a lot of people have. This is called Print on Demand‚Äî POD. It‚Äôs basically dropshipping for clothes, and other apparel items like mugs or keychains. There are definitely suppliers in China who will brand/design your clothes the way you want and loads of more mainstream services like Printify‚Äî which can be connected to Shopify. It‚Äôs up to you to figure out who you want your supplier(s) to be. Different people have different goals. 

Here is my advice to you. Do not spend a single cent in running any advertisements or anything outside of setup costs. When your site and social media presence is solid, have it reviewed here or somewhere else, and then run ads. 

Second piece of advice. Like I said, you need to have a social media presence. This goes to the larger point of, building a *brand*. Your designs might be absolutely amazing but if you don‚Äôt come across as a clothing brand no one will buy from you. Sites that don‚Äôt look professional can make sales but it won‚Äôt be consistent and usually it‚Äôs people who already have a following/audience somehow who are guaranteed sales. You as a brand need to act like any other online fashion retailer. You can do it all online and for free. Of course though if you spend money, you can order the items and either do your own photoshoots/videography or hire someone to help you with it. The actual pictures or stuff don‚Äôt have to be amazing but if the pictures show the real item, the authenticity will lead to sales. This. If you‚Äôre talking about creating graphic designs to go on a shirt and not designing the shirts themselves, this is a solid way to go. Do you design the graphics yourself? Where do you find suppliers to start a clothing brand Find something which solves problem and make style statement Literally everywhere haha clothes are on Aliexpress too! It really depends on your vision for your brand I would want to order from china because it‚Äôll be way cheaper. Do you have any recommendations? No, I don‚Äôt, sorry. I have looked into POD and my research has only taken me as far as the more ‚Äòlegit‚Äô suppliers such as Printify. 

But literally every brand sources from places like China, Bangladesh, India, etc. Even Printify sources their clothes from these places. 

It‚Äôll depend on your vision and resources to find a supplier. There are plenty of people on here who have fashion dropshipping sites and their clothes are from Chinese suppliers. But unfortunately they might not be succeeding because that is not the most important factor. Successful brands are ALWAYS changing their suppliers and even have multiple suppliers or entities in their manufacturing process. You cannot hinge your entire venture on the supplier. You‚Äôll always be able to find a source. So don‚Äôt worry about that part so much. 

What is your vision for your brand? Answer that first before answering the question of where you‚Äôll find the clothes.",2025-01-12 15:39:15

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* I haven't dropshipped jewelry, but you should try to have high profit margins, so when a customer wants to return something you can tell them to keep the product and refund them. Also make sure you have a great looking website, take note of what the competitions websites look like. As someone who designs and creates their own jewelry, I can tell you it‚Äôs a tough and saturated market. You definitely need to know your demographic and see what is trending. Jewelry that can be personalized is always hot. You also need to decide if you are selling low end or higher end pieces. Costume or Real. Boho or boho luxe? Minimalist or Statement. I suggest buying sample pieces of the items you may want selling, especially if your are sourcing from from China - way too many pictures are often misrepresented. There are also people who seem to not even be aware of the fact that the items they received are garbage metal alloys, and/or  plastic stones posing as gemstones (completely different cut, color, etc‚Ä¶). Or‚Ä¶. they don‚Äôt care, since their fake earrings cost $1.00. Know your metals and stones (if you are going with precious metals and semi-precious/precious stones. Targeted Ads are a must! Using your own photos are a plus as well. Highly descriptive info about the jewelry is extremely important, since people are allergic to certain metals and metal alloys. Include size options and actual size of jewelry, especially if you take the minimalist route. 
Even though the market is saturated, time, effort, and targeted ads can make all the difference. 
*I don‚Äôt have my glasses on, so I apologize for typos Most dropshippers use Aliexpress at the beginning for testing. After getting orders, some dropshippers will turn to sourcing agency or private agent for faster shipping and customized service. We own an agency in China for dropshippers based on membership. If you are interested, we are open to be reached out. Thank you for replying! 
Could you elaborate on the refund thing would work? Thanks a lot for the advice! 
Could you tell me more about how you create your own jewelry? If your profit margin is high enough and you're making successful sales. Like selling a $15 watch for $50 for example, you'd be able to afford letting your customers keep the items and refund them. Sometimes Amazon does this with some items",2025-01-12 14:12:40

Real cost of starting a dropshipping store
https://youtu.be/xRRiFdOAJSU?si=KgAuiNFPIkMZ8x-G

Can you start with no money
https://youtu.be/3VGTWJb5ZIk?si=bg4PvObZFbTWwMta 2 million dollars atleast Thank you all for replies Imo ‚Ç¨2-3k How much money do you need to start dropshipping? Let‚Äôs break it down.

First, you don‚Äôt need as much as you think‚Äîbut you need more than nothing. Starting a business is about resourcefulness, not resources. If you're tired of relying on your job for income, that‚Äôs a good motivator, but you need to shift your mindset from *'How little can I spend?'* to *'How smart can I invest?'*

Here‚Äôs the deal:

You‚Äôll need money for three main things:

* **Website and Hosting:** Around $30‚Äì50/month (think Shopify or WooCommerce).
* **Product Testing/Ads:** At least $500‚Äì1,000 to run ads and test products effectively.
* **Tools/Apps:** Another $50‚Äì100/month for automation tools, analytics, and email software.

If you‚Äôre working with less than $1,000, you‚Äôre in a tight spot, but it‚Äôs still possible. Focus on:

* **Organic Marketing**: Use TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts to drive traffic for free.
* **Validating Products**: Spend time researching before investing in paid ads.

The truth is, if you only have $200 or $300 to start, you‚Äôre better off stacking cash from your job and learning skills like marketing, sales, or content creation until you can invest. Dropshipping isn‚Äôt a lottery‚Äîit‚Äôs a business.

If you can get your head around that, the money will follow. Stop thinking about how much you need to start, and start thinking about how committed you are to seeing it through.

Thanks for info bro on the other hand, I should add that you can never be fully prepared (financially or mentally or in terms of skills, etc). the best advice I received about business is to just get started.

this is also the experience I gathered after helping over 630 dropshippers build their own brands as their private supplier. so the choice remains yours.

good luck! if he is still working, the question remains the same. just that he has an income. he doesn't need that much to sustain himself as he works on his ecommerce business.

in fact, with an income helps him quite a bit. no objection to that. some even started negative. it's a fair point.

I think OP is asking that because he is thinking of starting it on the right footing. that's a mature way of approaching business. what did you supply? We source the product you sell, customize your packaging and ship to your customers directly.

https://www.tiktok.com/@pocketdrifterz You can get a lot of the answers you want by searching on the internet, but you I'll give you my two cents.

When you're dropshipping, what you're actually doing is starting a business.  It's a good business to get into without much starting money, because you're not paying thousands of dollars to buy, store and ship products.  

Running a business is an endless process of solving problems, day after day after day.  And it's about continuously learning.

A good place to start is to make a list of the things you'll need, starting from most important.  

* An idea of what you want to sell
* A supplier that dropships these products
* A website to sell the products

Those are the tip of the iceberg.  I could probably do a list of 100 things you'll need, but the most important part of this is learning as you go.

One last piece of advice is to not let perfect be the enemy of good.  You should get to a point relatively soon where you know enough to launch your website. LAUNCH it.  It will likely suck, but something is better than nothing, and if you improve a little every day, eventually you'll be in a good place. 

Best of luck! thank you!",2025-01-11 09:00:29

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* At 18, you're in a golden spot. You've got time, energy, and (probably) fewer obligations than you‚Äôll have later in life. Here's the deal, though: businesses don‚Äôt fail because of the business model, they fail because people quit too soon or don‚Äôt execute properly**.** Dropshipping isn‚Äôt dead; bad execution is.

But let‚Äôs think about this logically. If you‚Äôre afraid of wasting time and money, it tells me two things:

1. You‚Äôre risk-averse (which is okay).
2. You‚Äôre looking for certainty in an uncertain game.

Here‚Äôs my advice:

1. **Learn Skills First** ‚Äì Dropshipping isn‚Äôt just about selling products; it‚Äôs about marketing, sourcing, branding, and scaling. These are universal skills. Whether you succeed or fail, you‚Äôre building skills that you can leverage in other ventures. So, start thinking, *'How can I use this to learn, even if it doesn‚Äôt work?'*
2. **Start Small** ‚Äì Don‚Äôt overinvest. Use low-cost tools, experiment with small ad budgets, and validate your product ideas. Think of it like paying for an education in entrepreneurship instead of a college class you‚Äôre not sure will apply.
3. **Play the Long Game** ‚Äì If you‚Äôre expecting massive success in 3-6 months, you‚Äôll quit when it doesn‚Äôt happen. Dropshipping is a stepping stone, not the final destination. It‚Äôs a way to test ideas and learn the ropes. You may move on to private label, branding, or even different industries entirely.
4. **Develop an Edge** ‚Äì Most people fail because they‚Äôre lazy. They copy-paste their way into mediocrity. If you‚Äôre willing to work harder, create better ads, and actually understand your customer, you‚Äôll outperform the average competitor.
5. **Reframe Your Fear** ‚Äì You‚Äôre worried about wasting time. But you‚Äôll waste *way more time* debating and hesitating than actually trying something and failing. The worst-case scenario is you spend a few months learning what doesn‚Äôt work‚Äîand that‚Äôs valuable.
6. **Check out this course** \- [Here is a free 7 day crash course](https://lp.dropshipxl.com/) about dropshipping that I have found to be super helpful. 

**It‚Äôs worth it, if you make it worth it.** Dropshipping won‚Äôt make you rich overnight, but it can teach you how to build a real business and help you figure out if entrepreneurship is for you. Focus on learning and taking action, and don‚Äôt overthink it. If you put in the work, it will pay off whether in dropshipping or something else. i‚Äôm 18 and just had my first store flop and let me tell you, it‚Äôs going to be a lot of workü§£ you‚Äôre most likely going to spend hours on multiple stores until you get a good product. that‚Äôs okay though, because once it hits its going to be great I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre gonna get the answers u expect asking a question like this On this sub lol Reframe what you‚Äôre doing. You want to start a BUSINESS. 

Is 2025 a good year to start a business? Sure, if it‚Äôs a good business that addresses a customer problem or services some sort of under-serviced demand. And you‚Äôre willing to learn and do hard work. 

Is 2025 a good year to start a pump-and-dump business that competes in the red ocean? Not really, but that‚Äôs never really been a good idea and most who have attempted it have failed. The time will pass regardless my friend

Do the inputs and learn as you go. It‚Äôs not a waste of time if you spend 5 years building something for it to ‚Äúfail‚Äù. You have gained 5 years experience and 5 years ahead of someone who never started anything I‚Äôll give it to you straight:
-It isnt dead, just start. Dont get stuck in analysis paralysis, dont get stuck in tutorial hell, dont get stuck ‚Äúlearning skills first‚Äù just start, you‚Äôll learn along the way, and you‚Äôll get better by doing. Your first store will probably fail, so look to go into that learning as much as possible about everything. Thats how you‚Äôll win.
Goodluck. It‚Äôs just like any other business. If you know how to do that, you can make dropshipping work. If not, practice, learn, fail, stop watching YouTube, and see how it goes. Doing is the best teacher Dropshipping is not an easy money scheme, selling dropshipping courses is, dropshipping is just starting a business without manufacturing, shipping, or holding onto goods yourself.  

You can do it for anything, like if starting a clothing brand you can dropship custom clothes until you're ready to ship yourself or swap to other suppliers and delivery methods.  Quality being bad or shipping being slow isn't a quality of dropshipping necessarily, thats more scammy people who don't intend to grow past that and are fine dealing with issues that come up with that. [https://pharaohfinds.com](https://pharaohfinds.com) The days of generic AliExpress products with long shipping times are kinda dead. The key now is finding a niche and branding like a pro. People don‚Äôt wanna buy random junk, they want cool, useful products that feel legit. Also, focus on building trust with your customers (good website, fast responses, clear shipping info). If you can get all that down, dropshipping can still be profitable. Just be ready to learn, adapt, and hustle. And hey, tools like ConvoSearch can help make sure your customers can easily find what they‚Äôre looking for on your site, which is clutch when you‚Äôre starting out. It will be a waste of money and you‚Äôll probably get nowhere with drop shipping or anything related to a Shopify store unless you have a unique product or a very profitable product that‚Äôs highly in demand. I know a lot of dropshipers who have succeeded and failed; when you ask out if you are starting dropshipping you are just trying to find reasons from others to convince yourself to start or quit. So what I'm trying to say is you have to look inside yourself instead of listening to the noisy voices on the internet. Dead internet theory. From fully human responses to semi human responses and then in a year or two, itll be completely AI generated Thanks so much for the advice This is great advice.  Thank you. honestly i think its just like grinding to get good at a game. first 10 hours ur a bot but if u chuck in hundreds of hours and u focus on learning ur guranteed to climb the skill ladder.",2025-01-09 12:05:08

I've just launched my very first drop-shipping store, and I'm excited to share my journey with you. My niche is pet supplies.

Here's the plan I've got so far:

**Marketing Strategy:**

\- Running Google Search campaigns with a daily budget of $10 for testing.

\- My goal is to achieve a conversion rate of >3%.

\- Total testing budget: $300 for this store.

\- Targeting regions: US, UK, Canada, Australia, and all European countries.

**Setup Status:**

\- Store is live and connected to domain

\- I've integrated Google Analytics and a Facebook Pixel for tracking already.

Now i'm currently optimizing the store by adding more images, after that I will begin the ads campaign

**Product Details:**

Selling price: \~**$118**

Product cost: \~**$40**

Shipping cost: \~**$9**

Revenue per sale: **\~$70**

After accounting for ads (assuming \~$30/sale), I'm aiming for $40 profit per sale. (I've experiences running meta ads but this time i let other friend running google ads for me so i don't know if this number is realistic)

This is my first attempt, so I know there's a lot to learn along the way. I'll keep updating the results.

Wish me luck! if you have tips for a beginner like me i'd love to hear.

**Update (8 Jan):**

* The campaign has gone live with a $10 daily budget.
* I've added the shipping cost to the pricing to offer free shipping. The selling price is now $129.9 + tax, which makes the total quite high. Since I'm just testing if I can sell the product, I've decided to set the price at $119.9 with free shipping. The profit per sale is now around $50. With an expected $20 ad cost per sale, the real profit I'll take home is about $30 per sale.

**Update (13 Jan):**  
I used a demonstration product featuring a video from YouTube, but unfortunately, it was reported for copyright violation, and the platform removed my product. Despite several back-and-forth conversations, I'm unable to sell that product anymore, which is quite frustrating.

Since it was the weekend, I couldn't take immediate action. Today, I searched for the same product on AliExpress and re-imported it to our store. The process is now complete, and I've relaunched the ad campaign.","**REPORT posts/comments if they are SPAM, self-promotion, or a store review/critique**

Good luck üëç What was the cost for you to start everything You're the reason for price surges, asshole. I read in a book that it might sound odd, but it actually works! $119.99 has a more appealing effect. Thank you for your suggestion! I'm not using Shopify but an alternative platform. While it's not as powerful as Shopify, it's a good starting point for now. It handles everything for me, including fulfillment, product returns, and all related tasks. you only need to focus on finding customers Write down all the aspects of a successful dropshipping store, and then treat each as a subject that needs extensive studying. I've seen some people achieve over a 6% conversion rate using just Google Search campaigns. I'm planning to test it by focusing solely on Google Search to compare its performance with Meta Ads right! it's all about taking action and learning as you go

btw, just updated the progress up to today. aliexpress i'd say the best way to learn is by running your own store. you‚Äôll pick up a lot along the way. I started by learning Meta Ads, which was a foundation. Setting up the store isn‚Äôt too difficult, and if you find it overwhelming, you can hire someone on Fiverr to help. The tricky part is optimizing your store, but that‚Äôs not critical in the very beginning. Focus on starting and improving as you go! just make creatives every day till u master them. make creatives for random products. I didn't use any spy tools out there. Instead, I found the niche by browsing Facebook to see what types of products were gaining attention. then double-checked the demand using Google Trends and Google Keyword Planner How's it going so far? I've saved your post as I want to do something similar. Following your journey and rooting for you! Dog supplies Everything exists for a reason, drop-shipping exists because it brings convenience to customers. If you don't like it, that‚Äôs fine Say that to every person in this sub Sorry, but the stupid zombies on social media are responsible if they can't lookup the stuff themselves and just immediately buy stuff like a consumer slave after seeing an ad. How are you keeping track or managing returns, theft, damage, and loss when shipping, and quality control?

Doesn‚Äôt the original company put their branding or business logo in or around the product?

Goodluck! Which platform is that? Can you share? Why dont you do both? Nice! Keep us updated how it goes, also share the link here if possible. bet thank you this has been the #1 advice i‚Äôve received fr. just gotta work on product research and creative skills the most Thank you for your answer, but I mean specifically the product you selected, what were you looking for and how did you decide it was the right product?

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* If you haven‚Äôt ran ads before you‚Äôre pretty much going to watch that money disappear. I personally would hop on Upwork and use that money to land a bit of consistent income + skills. $200 is fine to start BUT - if your ads don‚Äôt sell you won‚Äôt have more money for more ads. If you do sell something - you will break even (maybe even profit a few bucks) and still be sitting there waiting for payouts with nothing to do. So that‚Äôs why I say maybe focus on income first then dropship to supplement once you have something coming in. This is what did personally and it took over 9 months and 3+ clients before I could afford to start a store! Best of luck!! Time to test your hustle :) Well i guess we both share the same situation - planning to start drop shipping, $200 budget. 
Will share my experience so far.
Am beginning with tshirts. So the first hurdle was to look for supplier & am going with Qikink (ordered 2 shirts to check quality & satisfied)
secondly designs - in my quest to find great design i ended up getting scammed by one of those websites that apparently sell ""cool designs"" for a fair amount say under 500 (although they did send a file containing design but it was too far from being good) so started creating my own designs using PS with youtube tutorials. A hosting website - went with Shopify but turns out that i would have to shell out nearly 2k every month as subscription (am not even sure that i will make profit for the first 5 months or so) so maybe will go for a domain or will use social media for sometime. Ads is something that I haven't fully understood & i know if i run ads with fully understanding it my money is just gonna disappear.

https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLep-t3wpCPkWSJcyYiFsELQGLn-wzALvX&si=NAc1csVXnsJgwEXB 200 is too little for anything really. 
Unless you're using WordPress for your website and woo commerce, which I think is $15/yr.

Shopify costs me $39/mo and then ads are very costly too.

So I would say either save more, or do organic with WordPress. 

There's a huge learning curve for WordPress but with years of time left you'll have it. 

But if you're targeting Indian markets which is significantly cheaper the CPMs and CPCs are inexpensive compared to the US. Ads may be viable for you. 

Good luck tho! Curious to know how you would navigate these challenges. If you are going to dropship, do some research and figure out how to start Organic Dropshipping.

I'm 1.5k poorer after beginning, I don't drop ship I'm doing everything myself minus the sourcing so a little costlier. 

Pick some skills that you lack, and then work on them and sign yourself up on Upwork. 
Once you do that continue to practice by yourself. 

Just like you will need copywriting and product photography or web design or Photoshop for your store.
Work on these in your free time while having a gig up on Upwork, eventually someone would hire you there.

This HASN'T worked for me so far but I've gotten really good at Photoshop and CRO for my store. It will work I am sure. If it doesn't atleast you're an expert WORTH hiring, you won't need to hire a Photoshop expert or a copywriting expert.

On the other side if there's something else you can reliably generate capital on a steady pace keep it going.

I'm looking for a part time job but I've got exams and then I'm going to be moving through cities so a little hard for me.

Good things take time, if you don't have$50,000 in the bank to outsource things you will need to learn them yourself eventually. 
Can't run a $500 business with the expenses of a $50,000 business.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* saturated products that worked around this time last year or 2 years prior. just market it differently Search through all TikTok and fb ad library of what sells by searching fitness related keywords. Make a huge list. Check Google Trend for stability. Keep doing that until you kinda start knowing the market If the TikTok ban goes through there will be an eccomerce boom from the lack of TikTok shop Digital fitness bundles are huge right now- like selling a workout guide plus meal plan plus maybe a quick motivational video series. ppl love those all-in-one packages. Also consider Selldone to launch paywalls or sell virtual products (if you use Stripe), it supports that natively and is new to market.   
Test different niches (yoga for beginners, kettlebell workouts for busy moms, etc..) and double down on what sticks. Supplements always sell because most people just wanna see results and also do the minimum amount of work possible, if you can pair those with some workout from home stuff it seems like a good idea, I think your base will be women in their 30s-40s Gently used underwear. This is your business. Nobody is going to run it for you. If you‚Äôve done research and don‚Äôt know what to sell, maybe this isn‚Äôt for you? 

The success of this project is going rest on the quality of your product selection and retail proposition. This isn‚Äôt something you can just turn to Reddit to answer. If you are still not sure what to sell, I think hot items are a good choice. Different hot-selling products in different periods can be determined based on the 2025 e-commerce marketing calendar. Digital products are only profitable if you make your owns, kinda courses, apps, templates, books,... You are on Shopify and need to market organically?

What does that mean ? Hi!! Could you elaborate on ‚Äúmarket differently‚Äù or give an example of what that looks like If it‚Äôs saturated would the ads still be profitable? Thanks man, I‚Äôll look into these
Have a good day! How do you avoid lawsuits with supplements Great idea üòÅüëåüèº I kind of posted this knowing I wouldn‚Äôt get a full answer, everyone gatekeepers which I do not blame at all - you‚Äôll just be feeding competitors.

But for someone who hasn‚Äôt made a sale yet I‚Äôd like to to know what people have had success with etc 

Thanks for you‚Äôre comment :) Where can I find trending fitness products for free? Sorry I meant inorganic Unless you're them manufacturer most of the risk goes back to the supplier. Interesting response and read of my comment. 

I‚Äôm not trying to gatekeep at all. I like to think the quality, nuanced advice I‚Äôve given in subs like this over the years has helped create some great, sustainable business. More so than saying ‚Äòsell skipping ropes, bro‚Äô or ‚Äòcheck out my shitty winning product list, bro‚Äô ever could.

I don‚Äôt believe in giving a horse water, but leading it to drink. Click my profile, read through my gazillions of comments, get a feel for how I view and do e-commerce. You‚Äôll also learn the category I established a real brand in and how I went ideating and launching the brand. Social media But risk is the responsibility of the seller? Sorry I didn‚Äôt mean to come off as rude, I just meant that other people (not you) gatekeeping products is something I do understand.

And I really do thank you for you‚Äôre comment because I‚Äôd rather learn and do things myself than be given it without hard work :) Not necessarily. The risk is also the responsibility of the buyer. An adult is expected to do their own research of where supplements are made, where the ingredients are sourced, etc. 

If someone takes pills willy nilly from the internet wouldn‚Äôt you say that‚Äôs their fault, not the pill sellers fault? People are out there selling ‚ÄòBigfoots‚Äô fur‚Ä¶if it‚Äôs actually an allergen for someone who buys it, they can‚Äôt sue the seller of that item, it‚Äôs their stupid fault for buying such an item believing it‚Äôs real üòÇ I would just tell the customer to f*ck off. Nah, you‚Äôre fine.

Don‚Äôt worry about those ‚Äògatekeepers‚Äô. Copying them‚Äîif they even are having real success, as they‚Äôre probably not‚Äîisn‚Äôt going to help you. You‚Äôll just be descending into the red ocean. Lol this guy ahaha Thanks for you‚Äôre wisdom! I‚Äôll take this on board and keep you updated

How to filter out good and bad products
https://youtu.be/M1A0vTVFpRY?si=VQAehSUT997y8XVc

I would never start a fitness or beauty store due to how competitive the industry is. Rare for new products to come out that aren't saturated. Fitness and beauty are two different worlds Have you tried the Meta Ad Library? NGMI You can search for some free plug-ins on Google, which can help you analyze the value of the product. Or you can register for membership on some websites. Usually you can try it for free for a week. I recently searched for a website for TikTok product analysis, which can be tried for free. You will gain something if you search more. Do u guys even make any money with dropshipping like shopify store? I signed up for a course a year or so ago and they used helium 10 it‚Äôs a chrome extension. It lets you look at amazon products. You can see certain things and it‚Äôs supposed to help you find a good product. I am not sure but I believe they have a package that is very cheap so you could test it out. It was awesome to see and I think it would really help unfortunately I didn‚Äôt have the money to continue with the project. [removed] üëçüèº What should I focus on What is that can I get some more information on this ? Okay I‚Äôll look into it Is it better than auto ds? Both are a good niche What do you know more on? If you're a fitness freak then go in for that. Not Gonna Make It? Yeah but the problem is I am not finding a proper product for that You'll never find the perfect product man.

Imagine you sell a product that has TERRIBLE shipping and the product always arrives damages, but you didn‚Äôt order it or read the reviews to find out more. If you don't have the patience to wait for it to arrive nor the will to invest that much in your business, just forget it you've lost already lol That's not really what I want. Was just wondering if starting advertising before the product is delivered to you is even possible to make it faster. That product will probably take almost a month to be delivered so that's a big waste of time That's true! At least you need to see the sample images How did it go with the winning items? Steal TikTok/Meta ads, create stills, etc. Use Canva, Capcut, Eleven Labs, etc. Never said don't read reviews lmao. Your singular purchase experience will not mimic the next 5 persons' experiences.  Ordering from WA v. FL alone can be a different experience. Ordering 1 v 2 v bundling with a 3rd item can be a different experience. Etc etc. There are simply too many variables. If youre sourcing a single sample and it comes damaged / inoperable, you should have 100% detected that it was garbage based on the reviews, images, proposed functionality, etc. The only advantage I see to purchashing a sample is if you're interested in creating your own ad content OR the product is unproven/not reviewed BUT you're 95% certain you've found a unicorn (which is v unlikely, if not impossible, in today's climate). Idk‚Ä¶ my product arrived to me in a week lol. The fact that it‚Äôll take a month to be delivered should be less a concern for your own needs, and more a concern for what you‚Äôre going to subject your customers to. So you want to get sales when you've not even handled the product yet? 


Let's be honest...you want to turn a quick buck. Not the game for you. Launching in a couple of weeks so I‚Äôll let you know then Right What?? I was asking for any idea that I could use to already start promoting my tik tok, facebook or instagram. That's totally not wanting to get a quick buck.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* Most dropshippers use Aliexpress at the beginning for testing. After getting orders, some dropshippers will turn to sourcing agency or private agent for faster shipping and customized service. CJ is one of the agents. Thus far I'm not impressed with their Customer Service AT ALL. I had an Agent reach out from them but she just sends me generic messages asking what my niche is 4x!!! (Even after Ir explained). Also their Chat Window is hard to see if you're waiting in line or what. I did an RFQ 2 weeks ago & they still haven't got back to me...Conversely DSers are MUCH BETTER with Customer Support...Hands down. I'm not sure about the Shipping part yet though...CJ may be cheap & handy for importing Products but so not impressed with their ""Service"" & that's right at the get go too. Their Customer Service also struggle to understand basic direct questions so...that's just my experiences this far Works for some people. Not for others. We have many clients who were able to reach our MOQ of 30 daily orders before switching from CJ to us. DSers is a beloved one. CJ dropshipping tried to win me over with marketing but one day looking at it and I realized it‚Äôs all the same. They‚Äôre two programs pulling from the same website, so it just depends whose interface you prefer.

I found all my listings on AliExpress direct using their filters, then just added the URLs to the import list for DSers. You'll likely still have some kind of logistics and fulfillment issues with CJ but I think they're the best option if you don't want to use AliExpress. I have a review of CJ and other dropshipping platforms on my website Dropshipping Hustle if you're interested. Good luck Sucks, horrible experience. Ruined my business They're absolutely horrible, nothings ever their fault and they ignore any issues, until you start leaving reviews of them online, then they act If you need faster processing and shipping times, I think you can try working with an agent, which is more cost-effective than CJ. In the initial stage, will use AliExpress to quickly test the product, and when  reach a certain sales volume, will cooperate with agents. Here I would like to recommend qbsourcing, they have very good control over orders I was planning to do the same, however the quickest AliX shipping option available was Standard, which apparently takes 20-30 days

I‚Äôve heard CJ can do 5-14 days I agree with you

Their customer service seems kinda lost, and repeated ask the same, unnecessary questions without helping out with direct action All I mainly care about is a fast shipping time

I would directly order from AliX with standard shipping but it‚Äôs nearly a month time and not worth it

Some I‚Äôve talked to say that CJ averages 7-14 days I still want to buy from the AliExpress supplier, however I don‚Äôt want to use AliX‚Äôs shipping
Their quickest option, AliX standard, still takes 20-30 days

I‚Äôve heard CJ can source from the supplier and ship within 14 days, sometimes as quick as 3-4 days (from what I‚Äôve heard at least)

My main concern is just faster shipping, what do you recommend? What do you use for now? I‚Äôm buying directly from an AliExpress supplier, I just don‚Äôt like their 20-30 day shipping Please check PM Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but CJ dropship doesn‚Äôt do the shipping, the AliExpress seller does. CJ dropshipping just isolates those listings with the fastest times?

You can do the same with DSers, you just have to isolate those listings yourself. And I did it myself directly on AliExpress - by just checking off ‚Äúship from USA‚Äù I still use AliExpress and I find the shipping times aren't too bad outside of peak season. 

Once I start making consistent daily sales I request a VIP link which some suppliers will agree to. Then you can usually negotiate better shipping lines and faster processing times. Mina.. its not so popular but they do thousands and thousands of orders daily. They offer me cashflow solutions and a lot of free branding stuff like free branded shipping bags and invoices. And the prices are great since their warehouse is all AI.. less humans, less errors, cheaper cost",2024-12-17 21:16:50

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* Hey! I started 2-3 months ago and I‚Äôm already profitable. My advice would be to set aside a $1-2k budget. You‚Äôll need it for testing ads on Meta until you find a winning Ad. Organic strategies like going viral on TikTok are another option, but in my experience so far, they‚Äôre less reliable for consistent results. Just sharing what‚Äôs worked for me early on. I've gone through and done a few courses but this is the best overall course IMO. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqGNDT\_utao&t=58298s.

I personally spent around $1k before starting to be profitable. My buddy also started around the same time I did and he spent $500 on meta ads and didn't get a single sale. He's looking for another product to dropship now. Hey, my friend! Learning Shopify and dropshipping can be super easy. Here are some of the best ways to get started:  
  
Shopify has tons of awesome tutorials and courses on their website. You can learn all the basics there.  
  
There are also lots of online courses and videos on platforms like Udemy and YouTube. Lots of great free resources to check out.  
  
The best way is to just jump in and start your own Shopify store. You can begin with a free trial and add more as you go.  
  
As for how much money you need, you can start small - maybe around $500 to $1,000. That should cover the basics to get your store up and running.  
  
Once you start seeing success, you can reinvest your profits into marketing and scaling up. Lots of dropshippers invest $5,000 to $10,000 per month into growth.  
  
The key is to start small, learn as you go, and gradually scale your business. Let me know if you have any other questions By trying and failing and probably close to $2k depending on how skilled you are at it Don‚Äôt do it Learn the fundamentals by reading and watching videos and then you'll learn the most by actually attempting a Shopify dropshipping store. Be prepared you'll likely fail at first but don't let it deter you, everyone does with their first store.

I think you'll need a minimum of $500 but $2,000 would be preferred and give you a better chance of success.

I have a ton of free content on my website Dropshipping Hustle if you need some help. Practice with small budget. At the beginning, you can try organic to learn something and then paid ads and other marketing. Keep learning and improving. I think shopify official resources is enough, with Relevant Content I once read a comment here that went along the lines of,

""Dropshipping is like shooting and money is your bullets. The more bullets you have the better. With some luck you can definitely hit your target with one bullet or hit it eventually with a lot of bullets.""

The one thing I would add is that skills will also be your bullets.

If you keep throwing money at it, paying for a nice looking site, optimized SEO, lots of ads, branding, etc and keep doing that for many products, it would be hard not to succeed.

But that would cost... a lot.

You cut cost by learning the skills needed.

Designing a page is not out of this world difficult, but it can take time. There are free youtube courses for SEO that are hours long, they should give an idea about optimization. It is the same for copywriting, storytelling, social media, and management.

By bringing a lot of skill bullets, you do not have to bring as much dollar bullets.

You end only having to pay for ads and you make your ads convert more through copy and SEO.

TL;DR: If keep throwing money at it, chances are eventually something will stick. Or by learning the skills, you keep costs down. Spy on your dropshipping competitors, try to understand how they achieve success meaning how they find, market/promote winners, and try do reproduce the same by applying their method. how do people test so many products and i think i would rather learn on my own timing instead of spending on a course at the moment yk so just keep at it overtime you will get better consistency? Why not? got it thank you! what does ""branding"" means when we talking not about wearing shop? Bro screw most of these comments. Just take AliExpress pictures and post them on eBay buy downloading from AliExpress itself and try to make a decent description. (Here‚Äôs the hard part) you will have to post not one or two listings to test this out. You will have to potentially post hundreds (not to make one sale but to make multiple a week or a day.) it really is kind of a grind but it feels so good to actually accomplish it. Jordan's Library course is free and 18 hours in depth. You can skip the self-help stuff but I watched it since I like that type of content. I like that he covers everything you need to get started. 

From what I've seen from other people winning, the (1) ad and (2) product page are the two most important things in your success. Yessir once a store hits it gets usual sales and the better the execution the better you can scale the ads Also this is completely free until you make a sale i was actually doing that now on my own it just feels like it would work so don‚Äôt go the organic route? and yea i feel like that would be very informative should i go the organic route for now? It does I actually believe it or not started on Facebook marketplace and had to use a website called tracktaco.com to get fake usps, ups or FedEx tracking numbers because they wouldn‚Äôt accept AliExpress shipping The most effective way for you to build a long-term sustainable brand is by converting customers through paid ads. Meta is currently the best platform to be running paid ads on imo. 

Trying to get sales organically is very difficult since you have to rely on virality to sell your products and once the virality of your video dies down, so does your company. 

This dude preaches organic dropshipping by going viral on TikTok if you want to learn more. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWET-a9LMrk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWET-a9LMrk) Organic is terrible plus they‚Äôre shutting down Tiktok scale meta ads. Do split tests on different product pages made by ai Some item categories that have worked for me is night lights, belt buckles, and hats. Some products that sell good I just buy one to see it for myself and try to sell on marketplace which works for me. I actually am new to this and have upgraded to getting my second alibaba pallet so for 2 items I actually get them cheaper than AliExpress. It‚Äôs a journey that started from selling junk around my house and one day I actually just wanted to try it out and it worked. Progress is slow feeling but I do think back and realize I was selling junk for almost nothing back then and now I‚Äôm at a point where I need to make my business legal. yea i gotta good feeling about my stire im building maybe make my first sale any recommendations? I‚Äôm happy for you man least your trying I have showed my friends how to do it in person and they just don‚Äôt. üíØüéÜ KEEP UP THE WORK AND DONT GIVE UP UNTIL THAT SALE COME THROUGH. Then do the math on a money goal based off of amount of sales for your target. Don‚Äôt waste too much time on small fish but big fish might snap your line. Try to go medium Pagepilot or sumn that‚Äôs what I used initial stage how would you say your doing now store wise One winning store working on my second",2024-12-17 21:11:02

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* The product isn't great bro. Small selection and only one price point. 

I cant imagine a customer seeking out a belt specialist. Most are already loyal to a particular fashion brand. 

6 to 10 day shipping times wont do either. You'd be better off stocking 5 of each yourself and offering faster delivery. Try not to go for black/white theme , also your pictures are literally from your hand go on canva and remove background and add pictures to a better background or no background at all and ad product details You would probably be better off running meta ads. How many people on tiktok really need this product. This is without even looking at your product or your website to determine whether they‚Äôre ok or junk. 

You use TikTok right? Think about your behaviour on there for a second. Do you ever buy anything immediately after clicking an ad? Probably not. You‚Äôre on there for entertainment, you might click on the odd thing, and then you‚Äôre back to your entertainment, right? 

There‚Äôs a partial answer to your concern. Low conversion may stem from unclear messaging or navigation issues. Ensure your site loads fast, displays trust signals, and targets the right audience. Question: Do the visitors drop off on the product, cart, or checkout pages?

This basic info can give the best answer/pointer, so I can give you some of my insights (10+years in ecomm and web development) Save your money and Sell a different product bro. A product like this will be evergreen. When it comes to a belt like this, you will need to market it differently‚Äîin a professional sense. 

You will need to build a store solely dedicated towards the belt that looks very professional.

I would recommend you better optimize your text for mobile pages, you need to learn alliteration & word pairing, commonly used in copyrighting, for example ""Slim & Sleek""‚ÄîLike Apple for example, short and simple yet concise wording which will fit on Desktop and Mobile and register clearly to the consumer.

This product would better be fit for Instagram or Facebook, for something like this you cannot just throw together some videos and call it a day, you will need to consider Influencer Marketing and take your Content to the next level itself.

This product can definitely sell but you must realize when it comes to business everything comes down to marketing. >I cant imagine a customer seeking out a belt specialist. Most are already loyal to a particular fashion brand.

But.. but... Daniel Craig!!

And it's not just a belt!! It solves the age old problem of your shirt not staying tucked in during formal occasions or while leaping over rooftops chasing down a spy ala Bondstyle.

Seriously, I would imagine the market for such an item would be very, *very*, small. Two sales sounds pretty good. Market it toward the wedding crowds and big formal dressers, not for the average person and you might do better. Horrible advice.

Your way if thinking shows a small mind, do realize plenty of people wear cheap simple walmart belts (I've seen this first hand plenty of times)‚ÄîMost people do not stick to one belt ""specialist"" like it's Gucci or Louis Vuitton...

There are plenty of people to target with this product all it takes is the right understanding in business and marketing‚ÄîOP needs to think of a way to convert those who buy cheap unbranded belts to his belts so they feel they have ""a new home"", from here he can expand and contact manufacturers.

People like yourself move on too quickly and/or have shiny object syndrome, you cannot expect a product to work off the bat especially if you market it like all of your other products, everyone has a different ""goal"" with their Stores as well, some people are not looking to just go viral and get a quick $1k/day. i have 7-12 day shipping time and that works out for me fine. Thank you. So what do you suggest going forward? No, I haven‚Äôt got any abandoned checkouts yet. Daniel Craig's belt would have a quick release mechanism for the chicks. For the shipping times, OP should consider finding a way to reduce this as much as possible, once you reach $100-$200 in sales (rev) from your product you should begin considering ordering inventory of that product (your best selling one) and begin selling it directly to the consumer ‚Äî From this point you want to begin branding and slowly shift out of the Dropshipping phase.

The guy wants to improve his conversion rate. Faster shipping would do that.

For customers, slow shipping means slow returns and even slower refunds if things go wrong. You need to look at it from the customer's eyes. What do I suggest? 

1. Take in what I say in my comment and let that inform how you advertise on platforms like TT. 

2. Just looked at your website. Don‚Äôt rip off low-res images of Daniel Craig; put your product front and square and communicate to me in a nano second what it does and why I should give a shit; make it easy for me to buy as at the moment you don‚Äôt have a menu and I have to scroll beyond the image that‚Äôs probably made be bounce to find a CTA; buy your product and get some QUALITY product and lifestyle shots and videos‚Äîconsider taking a ‚Äòhome shopping‚Äô network approach to selling it; it‚Äôs not a luxury product. 

3. I found go on and on. But, look at how other single product/few SKU brands that solve problems have gone about communicating with their customer. You should mate - it optimizes your results in seconds. [CartBoss.io](http://CartBoss.io) \- just check it out, you wont regret it But if he doesn't get sales he's possibly losing all that money he spends on the belts depending on the return policy as well Yep.

You‚Äôre starting a BUSINESS and you need a BUSINESS bank account. The bank you use personally‚Äîset up with them at this early stage. 

Have you registered your business and so on? Go to Google and search ‚Äòhow to start a business in the UK‚Äô, go to the first website with .gov.uk in the domain, and follow the checklists. 

Sounds to me like you‚Äôre being asked for business registration info. 

There‚Äôs a trend in this group where people use terms like ‚Äòdropshipping‚Äô and ‚ÄòShopify‚Äô as though they‚Äôre business models or types. They‚Äôre not. One is a distribution model and the other is a software. You‚Äôre starting a BUSINESS that will be in the RETAIL industry. I use Tide. From the UK as well. If you're just starting out though I wouldn't suggest setting up a business or applying for business cards. Use personal cards first and set up as a sole trader.

I‚Äôd also incorporate somewhere with better tax rates/economic outlook personally. Mate open wise and stripe account and just the standard UK bank account you‚Äôll be fine! I use Monzo.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* I would not even have involved it in my plans of what market/items to focus on.

7k is almost nothing and you can expect that to drop significantly again as you rebrand it or start posting promotional videos.  
And still its not a given that anybody of that small group that is left is even interested in what you are promoting.

Finding a market and category to break into is hard enough as it is without limiting yourself to having to build it around a 10-15$ instagram account. Anyone still following you are people who don‚Äôt know who you are and don‚Äôt care to unfollow dead pages/people. If you start posting again and appear on their FYPs, yes there is chance they‚Äôll vibe with your post/ad and buy your product but likely what‚Äôll happen is a bunch of people will unfollow you. 

Even if you post exactly the same content as what you originally posted, you‚Äôll lose followers, because peoples tastes change‚Äî remember they‚Äôre not still following you in the hopes that‚Äôll they‚Äôll get that content again, it‚Äôs because they literally forgot you/to unfollow. 

So that being said, if you want to use this page for dropshipping, go ahead, whoever sticks around, will. As for how you do it, that‚Äôs totally up to you, marketing strategies are varied. You can follow the branding you started with, you can do something different, whatever‚Ä¶but make sure it makes sense with your brand/products. As long as the product is in the same niche. Otherwise start a new account. If I were to create a new account should I make a specific niche theme page or should I make it based on a product and try to get a viral video? I‚Äôve seen do both methods which do you think is more effective?",2024-12-12 09:50:18

https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLep-t3wpCPkWSJcyYiFsELQGLn-wzALvX&si=NAc1csVXnsJgwEXB This may not work as you think. It takes a lot to attract fashion customers and from my clients who do fast fashion in the 7 and 8 figures, their conversions struggle even with just fashion consumers alone. To attract people for decors and then have them come to the site to buy clothes and vice versa, it will take quite a bit of effort/trial and errors to perform. I highly suggest looking into your strategy a bit more. Can you explain why its too late to start a store for Christmas products? Is it because the pixel needs time to warm up or just how little time is left to milk such niche? Yeah, I know that I‚Äôm kidna late with the Christmas stuff, but I‚Äôm not expecting any real sales on them since I just started. Regarding the UX UI, what recommendations you have specifically? Thanks a lot I‚Äôm not planning on running a fast fashion brand. It is an actual high quality designer brand, that is run as a complete separate entity, because I‚Äôm not the only owner of it. And for me its really cost effective to sell it on the same website Christmas is 10 business days away. Shipping time takes around 5 to 10 business days and sometimes longer unless your suppliers are shipping locally then it's a risk to ship Christmas products now. This is also the period where I start scaling back campaigns. Will be making a video on this soon. 

Also by the time you test and find your winning ads and formula, it'll be too late. Just go on youtube and look up UX/UI for ecommerce tutorial or something along those lines From an operational stand point, I can understand your logic. From a marketing standpoint, it would still be tough. What you're describing sounds like an Anthropologie or Nordstrom, is that correct??",2024-12-11 11:05:22

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* I would not dropship clothing, I wrote an article about why it's a bad idea on my website ""Dropshipping Hustle"" if you want more info. 

Hobby niches are good because you're targeting passionate people. I also like pets and educational kids toys because I target women over 40 as they're big online spenders, especially when it comes to their pets and kids/Grandkids. Fashion is probably one of the hardest categories to get into, especially ESPECIALLY if you‚Äôre dropshipping‚Äîyou‚Äôre not creating anything new or interesting. 

If you‚Äôre serious about starting a worthwhile business look inward, figure out what you‚Äôre good at/passionate about and what are YOU best at selling, and use that as a way of starting your ideation. 

Me, I‚Äôm an avid hiker. Thus, it was a no brainer to do something in the hiking space. And I didn‚Äôt just go out and spin up a store filled with junk. I turned to the community and looked for a problem to solve/underserviced demand. Turned out that aligned with a bit of an itch I had. No niche will work for you. Sorry Go for pet products. People spend crazy money on their pets, and it's emotional buying. Start with a specific niche like dog toys or cat grooming. Find suppliers on platforms like Spocket or CJ Dropshipping; they usually have decent quality.

For free marketing, spam TikTok and Instagram. Post daily‚Äîshort videos showing the product in action, like a dog playing with a toy or a cat chilling with a grooming glove. Use trending sounds and hashtags. Interact with comments to boost engagement. Cheap products, viral content = potential goldmine. Those niches are huge , did you drill into sub niches? Are you a total douche bag?!  Nobody is giving up that information.  What has worked best for you? Interesting, I will take a look, thanks Let‚Äôs talk in private if that‚Äôs something you do.",2024-12-09 17:03:04

While I'm allowed to share product links, the company mainly focuses on wholesale PC sales, not individual components.

The only source of joy in her life is thinking about her grandkids.

A product like **customized holiday-themed envelopes** or **personalized money-gifting kits",opportunity,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropship/comments/1h8fklb/step_by_step_guide_to_get_a_succesful/,STEP BY STEP GUIDE TO GET A SUCCESFUL DROPSHIPPING STORE BEFORE THE NEW YEAR,"Hello The title says it all so let us just get to it.

Dropshipping isn't easy but it is way easier than working a job.

The main difficulty you guys face is you lack the ability to act without someone telling you what to do.

I CALL IT THE WORKER SYNDROME.

YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD WHAT TO DO YOUR WHOLE LIFE, AND YOU ARE SO AFRAID TO MAKE A MISTAKE THAT YOU DON'T USE YOUR CREATIVE ENERGY.

So, I won't try to fix that syndrome now we will leave that for another post but to begin here is a step by step guide for you to get  a succesful dropshipping store before the new year.

# WHAT TO EXPECT?

In this guide, you‚Äôll find **everything you need** to build your first successful dropshipping store **step by step**.

The success that you will recieve won't be out of this world.

IT IS SIMPLY TO PROVE TO YOU IT IS POSSIBLE AND EASY TO SETUP **A PROFITABLE BUSINESS.**

**So the goal is to get more than what you invested.**

STEP 1: **CHOOSING A PROFITABLE NICHE**

how to pick a profitable Niche?

EVERY NICHE IS PROFITABLE BUT WHAT YOU SHOULD AIM FOR IS TO GET INTO THE NICHE'S THAT ARE **UNDERSATURATED.**

Dropshipping is full of oversaturated niches where competition is brutal, and profits are razor-thin. These are the niches where **everyone and their cat** is running ads:

* Fitness gear
* Phone accessories
* Beauty products
* Pets
* Home decor
* Clothing

AND THE MOST OVERSATURATED NICHE: TRENDY SHITTY PRODUCTS.

AVOID ALL OF THESE NICHES AT ALL COSTS.

# WHERE YOU WIN: THE UNDERSATURATED NICHES

The real money is in the niches **no one is paying attention to yet**. These are markets that are less competitive but still have a strong, untapped demand.

  
**1. THE BOOMER MARKET**

The boomer market is selling to the people out of the bubble, who probably don't even know what dropshipping is.

This market is a goldmine because of the following simple facts

1. Boomers don't have ADHD so they don't need to be entertained.

Boomers just need the supply to their demand on the simplest products.

I know a individual who generated millions in the boomer market selling post envelopes to grandpas and grandmas.

The ads were the cheapest kind and the simplest kind (pictures of envelopes).

This is a window to selling the most basic products to the most basic people.

Your job in this market is to make the process of the supplying the demand as simple as possible.

and the potential is endless.

//

**STEP 2: HOW TO PICK A WINNING PRODUCT** 

 To pick the winning product in our chosen undersaturated niche we have to put ourselves in the shoes of the target customer in this niche.

Ask yourself:

1. **What problem does this customer face daily?**
   * Winning products solve specific problems or make life easier.
2. **What does this customer desire most?**
   * Products that bring convenience, joy, or comfort will always sell.
3. **What would make this product irresistible?**
   * Is it affordable? Unique? Easy to use? Products that hit all three are unstoppable.

  
so let me answer that question for the boomer market 

# 1. What Problem Does This Customer Face Daily?

**Problem:**  
Grandma dedicated her life to raising her kids, but now she finds herself in a nursing home feeling **lonely** and without a sense of purpose. The only source of joy in her life is thinking about her grandkids. She cherishes every opportunity to connect with them, especially during holidays or special occasions, but struggles to find meaningful ways to stay in touch.

**Solution:**  
Grandma loves sending money to her grandkids during holidays as a small token of her love. A product like **customized holiday-themed envelopes** or **personalized money-gifting kits** could help her feel connected to her grandkids, adding a thoughtful, heartfelt touch to every letter or gift she sends.

# What Problem Does This Customer Face Daily?

Grandma feels lonely and disconnected while living in a nursing home. She lacks a sense of purpose and deeply misses her grandkids, who are her only source of joy. She wants to connect with them regularly, especially during holidays, but struggles to make the gesture special and meaningful.

# What Does This Customer Desire Most?

Grandma desires a way to easily stay connected with her grandkids while expressing her love and care in a thoughtful way. She wants something that adds a personal, heartfelt touch when she sends money or letters on holidays and special occasions.

# What Would Make This Product Irresistible?

To make this product irresistible, it needs to be:

1. Affordable: Something that doesn‚Äôt strain Grandma‚Äôs budget.
2. Unique: Customized or themed envelopes that stand out, making her gifts feel special.
3. Easy to Use: Simple, ready-to-go designs that require little effort from Grandma, while adding joy for her grandkids.

# STEP 3: SETTING UP THE PERFECT STORE

Setting up the perfect store is one of the biggest challenges new dropshippers face. A big mistake beginners make is trying to build the store themselves. This not only adds to the learning curve but often results in poor design, which kills their chances of success.

**Solution:** Have a professional build the store for you.  
However, **your job** is to provide clear instructions so the store matches the needs and expectations of your **target customer**.

Here are the general questions you need to ask and answer to give your outsourced professional the best guidance:

^(Note: If you need help finding a outsourced professional who get the job done for you for a cheap price while maintaining the quality, I can help)

# Questions to Guide the Store Design

1. **What would make my target customer trust this store?**
   * **Answer:** Include trust-building elements like clear return policies, customer reviews, secure payment icons, and an easy-to-access ‚ÄúContact Us‚Äù page. Use a clean and organized layout to build confidence.
2. **What type of colors and design appeal to my target customer?**
   * **Answer:** Choose colors and a design style that resonate with your audience‚Äôs preferences. For example:
      * **Younger audiences**: Bold colors, modern visuals, and sleek designs.
      * **Older audiences**: Soft, calming colors and traditional layouts.
3. **How can I make the store feel like it‚Äôs built for my target customer?**
   * **Answer:** Use images, messaging, and product descriptions that speak directly to their desires or problems. Show visuals that reflect their lifestyle or needs.
4. **How do I make the product pages clear and easy to understand?**
   * **Answer:** Use simple language, large readable fonts, and clear bullet points to highlight product benefits. Include high-quality images, a video if possible, and a clear **Call-to-Action** like ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù or ‚ÄúBuy Now.‚Äù
5. **How do I reduce hesitation about buying online?**
   * **Answer:** Add trust indicators such as:
      * **Shipping details**: ‚ÄúFast and reliable shipping.‚Äù
      * **Guarantees**: ‚Äú30-day money-back guarantee.‚Äù
      * **Social proof**: Customer testimonials or reviews.
6. **What should my target customer experience when they visit the store for the first time?**
   * **Answer:** The store should feel inviting, easy to navigate, and tailored to their needs. The homepage should clearly showcase the product, highlight its benefits, and make it easy for them to take the next step.

# Example (Grandma):

If your target customer is **Grandma**, you might answer:

* Trust: Clean layout, big fonts, ‚Äúsafe and secure purchase‚Äù guarantee.
* Design: Soft, calming colors and relatable images of grandparents and grandkids.
* Experience: A welcoming homepage showing how the product solves her problem.



**STEP 5: CREATING A SIMPLE MARKETING STRATEGY**

Here is another place where most beginners in the dropshipping marketplace make a huge mistake. For me, running ads and targeting the right customer is incredibly simple‚Äîafter all, I am the smartest man alive (this whole post was just a sneaky way for me to flex, let‚Äôs be honest).

But what about you?  
You‚Äôve got two options:

1. Watch tutorials on how to target customers efficiently.
2. Hire an outsourced professional to set up your ad campaigns for cheap.

Whichever path you choose, the next step is all about understanding your target customer. Once again, we ask and answer the right questions to create ads that speak directly to them.

  
**Questions to Match Your Target Customer**

# Where does your target customer spend their time?



To market effectively, you need to know where your audience hangs out:

* Younger Customers: TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube.
* Older Audiences: Facebook, email marketing, or even Pinterest.
* Niche Communities: Reddit forums, hobbyist Facebook groups, or niche blogs.

For my case exampe: Grandma is most likely on facebook as that is the oldest social media platform.

# 2. What Would Make the Ad Grab Their Attention?

* Use visuals that reflect Grandma‚Äôs story and the product‚Äôs emotional value:
   * A smiling Grandma carefully placing money into a beautifully designed envelope.
   * Grandkids happily opening the letter, smiling, and hugging their gift.

**Ad Hook:**

* ‚ÄúGrandma‚Äôs Love Delivered: Make Every Holiday Gift Special üíå‚Äù

# 3. What Message Speaks Directly to Their Emotions?

For Grandma, the emotional hook is about connection and nostalgia. Frame the ad to emphasize love, family, and meaningful moments:

**Example Ad Copy:**  
*""Every letter from Grandma carries love, not just money. Our beautifully crafted gifting kits help her stay close to the grandkids who mean everything to her. Make this holiday unforgettable. üéÅ""*

**Why It Works:**

* This messaging tugs at the heartstrings, showing the product as a **bridge for connection** and love.

  
**4. What Kind of Offer Would Motivate Them to Buy?**

To reduce hesitation and drive sales, use simple incentives:

* **Free Shipping**: ‚ÄúFree delivery for orders placed this week!‚Äù
* **Limited-Time Holiday Discount**: ‚Äú20% off
* **Guarantee**: ‚Äú100% satisfaction guarantee





# AND THERE WE HAVE IT.

All it takes is **5 simple steps** to get your successful dropshipping store up and running.

**IT REALLY IS THAT SIMPLE.**

But then again‚Ä¶  
I‚Äôm not just the smartest man alive.  
I‚Äôm also the most humble, the greatest strategist, the king of execution, a visionary, a modern-day genius‚Ä¶ honestly, I‚Äôd keep going, but I don‚Äôt want to make the rest of you feel bad.

You‚Äôre welcome.

Get your Mini Projector now for only **¬£59.99 GBP** (taxes included) and uncover a world of entertainment! Hey, it's great that you want to start! Before making any ads, I would recommend checking out your competitors and looking for YouTube videos on how to properly set up and optimize a store. You‚Äôve got the basics down, like adding products, but now focus on how to further optimize and design your store. Don‚Äôt go online just yet‚Äîkeep building and refining everything. Good luck, you'll get there! üí™ The black-and-white color contrast on your homepage feels a bit unbalanced, with the black section between the white blocks appearing quite harsh. Also, there‚Äôs a lack of detailed product descriptions. The homepage‚Äôs structure could use some improvement as well (as suggested by others in the thread). I recommend focusing on systematically optimizing the UI layout first, then improving the visuals, and adding more informative content about your product to better guide potential customers. Need t&c page, tracking, faqs, reviews etc I think having the product details in a product page section rather than in homepage would do better. Homepage can be pictures of product and brief on what your product is and why buy. Here are my thoughts, instead of a one product store, have a bunch of products 10+, even if you don‚Äôt expect them to sell - this way when you run ads for that one product, your store comes across as more legitimate. At the moment you have one product page on a .org (get a .com or a localised .com.xx if you are selling to your own country in particular), a store logo/name that doesn‚Äôt match the web address, no links to support pages like shipping info/tracking, contact us, about us etc - this will all translate to no trust and ultimately no sales.

Here's how I found my POD dropshipping suppliers
https://youtu.be/4TgNcl1UUhk?si=kODXPBRZWFtJf52I We own a member-based agency named dseragent for dropshipping. We offer sourcing, fulfillment and pod customization for dropshippers. Our benefits are transparency, no mark-up, customer-oriented. If you have interests, please let me know. Printify and Printful are excellent starting points for print-on-demand. A private supplier could provide better margins, but start with these platforms to validate your idea before committing to private arrangements. I have personally used Printful for a year back a few years ago and it was pretty easy to work with. I was very satisfied with the quality and results. The option to buy a discounted sample product was very nice as well. Not sure if they still do that or not nowadays.",2024-12-03 14:58:47

Instead of setting $100 per day, my overtired brain decides $1 is the perfect number.

Did I double-check it? Of course not. I hit¬†*Save*¬†and passed out, dreaming of flawless ROAS and skyrocketing conversions.

Fast forward to the next morning:

* *Impressions:*¬†14.
* *Clicks:*¬†0.
* *Comments from the client:*¬†‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶is the campaign live?‚Äù

Cue my mini heart attack. I checked the dashboard, realized what I‚Äôd done, and quickly fixed it. But here‚Äôs where it gets weird those 14 impressions? One of them was from someone who DM‚Äôd the client about a bulk order.

Yup. A¬†*$1 budget*¬†somehow found the most qualified lead on the planet.

Now the client won‚Äôt stop asking, ‚ÄúCan we try the $1 strategy again?‚Äù And honestly? I‚Äôm just trying to pretend it was all part of my master plan.

Glad it worked out!! Always happy to read when things work out is a dollar is 14 impressions then $100 should be 1400 impressions noü§® Its true, i was the $1 dollar Same post 2 weeks ago? 14 impressions for a dollar isn't bad to be honest. Something something algorithm reset technique something something. That‚Äôs how I‚Äôd word it. I used to run $1000/day campaigns and sometimes I‚Äôd drop to $5 for a week and scale back and it‚Äôd work.

I'm like your client, when I find success and low ACOS for a day, I study the factors against other aspects of the campaign that were much less successful and I tweak away, dreaming of the perfect campaign set up.

Sadly, it's rarely a pattern you can replicate and almost always pure chance, people are unpredictable As someone who studied statistics‚Ä¶ for the love of GOD do not ever let them do the $1 campaign again ü§£ It seems luck is on your side, doesn't it? Um wasn't this posted in the PPC subreddit days ago? Nah bro got the dawg in him gotta charge extra for the $1 strategy man Haha, you‚Äôre absolutely right! The clickbait practically writes itself: ‚ÄúHow I Turned $1 Into Millions ‚Äì No Gimmicks, Just Pure Genius!‚Äù üòÇ There is something to be said about incentives on Google‚Äôs side for the PPC strategy.

My company invests $#K per month into Search Ads for one of our SKUs. CPC ~$12

I invest $300 per month into Search Ads for one of my side projects. CPC $0.10

If my side project CPC was $12, I‚Äôd no longer be a paying customer. And it‚Äôs a much worst idea than my company‚Äôs profitable SKU.

Busted. üòÇüòÇüòÇwait till he sees this Ladies and gentlemen we got em Ahahahah this made my day. :) Yup if the maf maths. The impressions appear as long as the click budget has not been exceeded. That means it appeared on 14 searches before somebody clicked the ad and exhausted the budget for the day. It could have gotten 1400 impressions that day if nobody clicked the ad before that number. You pay for clicks, not impressions. This shit just made me spit out my coffee Yeah, I remember this post, word for word. Pricing Facebook ads services often depends on factors like the scope of work, business goals, and the size of the ad spend. Here are a few common approaches I use

1. Flat Fee per month   
2. Percentage on ads spend usually 10 - 15%  
3. Sometimes a combination of both.

like the design though You should be doing a ton of research on products, your target ausdience, location of audience etc befor eyou even touch making a website.

There are many things I couldn't figure out and configure, so i had to brush some rust on my HTML, CSS, JS. yeah, I couldn't get to that point yet. I'm still working on SEO, content and products.
I want to test them all eventually.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* Garbage It looks just like a regular theme. 

What did your product build in 5 minutes ? Do you support abandoned cart recovery? Once i get the tool i can you use it to build unlimited stores ? Thank you for the question. It automatically sets up the entire store structure with all the elements that usually take hours to configure:

- Product page layout
- Homepage sections & layout
- Trust badges in strategic locations
- Social proof sections
- Optimized add-to-cart buttons
- Mobile-friendly navigation
- FAQ section

Basically saves you from spending days configuring everything manually. You just plug in your product and it's ready to sell. OneClickStore doesn't have built-in abandoned cart recovery, but you can integrate it with any Shopify app you're already using for that. It works seamlessly with all the popular apps out there. Yes, you can use it for multiple stores. It's a one-time payment and you can create as many stores as you want. No monthly fees or store limits. Most paid theme have all those pre built Yeah, but for abandoned cart recovery, you can always use [CartBoss.io](http://CartBoss.io) \- highly recommend you checking this solution out ;) We developed it, so if you have any questions, just let me know. Thats amazing. I'm buying it today. Does it support multiple languages ? Actually, standard themes are quite different. Regular paid themes:

- Come as templates you need to configure
- Require you to design and set up every section manually
- Often have too many options which can be overwhelming

With OneClickStore you don't need to make design decisions or spend hours in the theme customizer - it's already ready to go. Thanks for your interest!

I‚Äôm hoping to get some guidance on a business setup conundrum. I previously lived in India, where I ran a dropshipping business as a sole trader. Although the business is no longer active, I still retain the sole proprietorship in India. Now, I‚Äôve moved to the UK and am planning to start a new dropshipping business here.

My main questions are around the best structure for this. Should I use my existing Indian sole trader setup, or is it more practical (or necessary) to establish a new sole trader business in the UK? From a tax perspective, operating from India seems more favorable, but I‚Äôm concerned about the logistics, legality, and day-to-day management from the UK. I‚Äôm also unsure about the implications this setup might have with payment providers and platforms like Shopify.

So, I‚Äôd like to understand:
	1.	Can I legally use my Indian business while residing in the UK?
	2.	If it‚Äôs legally feasible, is it a practical or advisable approach?

Only if you fail to declare to the UK's HMRC any income from your Indian business => tax evasion

It's trivial to setup as a sole trader in the UK:  
[Register as a sole trader](https://www.gov.uk/become-sole-trader/register-sole-trader)

It's basically registering to pay tax via self assessment.

>So, I‚Äôd like to understand: 1. Can I legally use my Indian business while residing in the UK? 

Yes but you still have to register to pay tax in the UK.

>2. If it‚Äôs legally feasible, is it a practical or advisable approach

IMO, it would make things more complicated for you, in respect of tax, admin and currency exchange/transfer issues.  I'm unclear how VAT would be handled if you are trading in the UK from an Indian entity - perhaps others know. I'm new to all this drop shipping business so hoping to get as much knowledge and information as possible - lets say if I use AliExpress has my wholesaler, can I use platforms such Amazon and eBay to dropship and sell my products or would I need my own website? Thanks! From my experience, suppliers like working with LTD companies rather than sole traders. That‚Äôs what wanted to understand. I‚Äôm also leaning towards setting things here in the UK as the other setup makes things complicated for me.

Ok thanks for clearing things up. 
I‚Äôm not an expert, but I think you could go with either option, or even both, depending on your goals. Each approach has its pros and cons.

For example, with platforms like Amazon and eBay, you don‚Äôt need to worry about generating traffic, as they already attract a large audience. You might still need to invest in ads, but the traffic tends to be more qualified, as people visit these sites specifically to buy. The downside is that these platforms charge commissions, which can impact your profit margins.

On the other hand, with your own website, you‚Äôd need to handle marketing to drive traffic, but you wouldn‚Äôt have to pay any commission, allowing you to keep a larger share of each sale potentially.",2024-11-09 07:08:24

My personal experience - I‚Äôm in the process of a product that cost me $0.36 in raw material that I am planning on launching at $9.99 (which is low to subvert temu knockoffs) I think people will start looking for products out of China If it goes through (which most likely will not in full extent as China could impose the same on US and US has a lot of money from exports) all the platforms will simply start moving to Thailand or other countries from which they would ship, still taking advantage of the subsidized shipping rates and not being officially in China.

I still feel like I have a mountain to learn, but with what I've learned, if I don't make at least 6 figures next year, I'll consider it a failure. If you work hard, push through obstacles, and prioritize trying to always move forward, it will work. Depends on how much work you put into it. I think 90% or more will fail.

https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLep-t3wpCPkWSJcyYiFsELQGLn-wzALvX&si=NAc1csVXnsJgwEXB

I took on a subscriber and they managed to hit $10,000 in sales with 35% profit last week. It took them 6 months to get to where they were. You can find their results on my Instagram highlights. I started working on my idea about a month ago and there's so much to learn ahead.
Up until this point, I had to put myself in a different role to plan accordingly. My motivation has been a rollercoaster, but I haven't stopped working on it. Simply having a website is not enough. You need good content, marketing strategy, dealing with suppliers and the most critical of all - Do not stop believing in yourself im doing it since july and I managed to get my first sale a month ago, right now im on 10 sales barely breaking even You can hit 50k+ profits in a few months easily, just consume the correct content and test shit properly. Very difficult!  It‚Äôs business at the end of the day. dropshipping can be a grind. Margins are thin, and getting profitable means nailing down a solid niche, reliable suppliers, and killer marketing. Six figures is possible, but it‚Äôs a lot of testing, tweaking, and hustling to get there. No successful business is easy to run, so expect to spend a lot of time to make a dropshipping business successful. However, once you get it, it can go very far. I‚Äôve done close to 6 figures in a month, so it is definitely possible! You just need to do it the right way, and I‚Äôd also advise you to have a business partner. Another tip, see what your competitors are doing. Make use of Virgil Abloh‚Äôs  3% rule. Difficult. There has been at least 100 of these posts made in this sub in the past week. 

Based on your inability to research and lack of work ethic you have no chance at ever being successful as a entrepreneur and certainly not as a dropshipper. That is encouraging.  Thank you for your reply.  $60k in profit in 18 months is really good.  People who work jobs don‚Äôt often think about how hard it is to generate even $20 in income on your own. Are you constantly moving to a new product or have you found one product that is stable and profitable? How much time would you say you invested on average per week? Really ? I want to make the same too. Please help Good numbers, congrats! Did you start a branded product from the start? I‚Äôm not afraid of the work or of putting money into it.  I just wanted to see if it was real or if it was mostly social media hype for views. I‚Äôm always skeptical of people that create content claiming they know how to be super successful at something.  I figure that if they were really successful, they would be doing it instead of making content about it. Thank you for the information you provided.  This is encouraging. I guess the challenge is figuring out the correct content and figuring out how to hit your customer base with advertising so they know you‚Äôre there. How dare you say that?

E-commerce is only growing from year to year. We must stop seeing dropshipping as a business model. It‚Äôs e-commerce! And e-commerce is not dead and will never be.

You just have to stop believing that it‚Äôs easy... it‚Äôs a real job. I‚Äôve considered joining a network like Classic Computers, something that has a lot of domestic suppliers.  Subscriptions to such services can be pricey but might be worth it to keep a reliable supply chain.  My hesitation has come from not really knowing much about the products they can provide.  How important is knowledge of the product itself? That‚Äôs my concern.  I don‚Äôt know if I should just try to sell products that I think will make money or if I should try to build a brand of some kind. While testing things, I stumbled across one specific niche product which was very profitable. I then turned it into a collection of similar products. That has lead to long-term profitable stability. I still test, with products in my niche. But not enough, I'd like to do more testing. A lot of my time this year has been spend building brand and systems. That's a hard question to answer, as it fluctuated. At the beginning? As much as I possibly could, as I was obsessed. What do you need help with? Thanks. No, brand stuff came later.

- (5‚Äô) First, think of the ‚Äûvibe‚Äú your stores gives. 
Is it pet toys? Is it women‚Äòs clothing? Is it tech gadgets? 

- (15‚Äô) Second, think of the season.
Ex. What do people need in times where it is cold outside? What if your pet can‚Äòt go outside? etc.

- (3h) Third, Facebook Ad Library. This is research. Take it seriously. Attack this with the terms you‚Äòve found in the first and second phase.

- (^) Fourth, Check for the number of active ads
Minimum of 15-20 in the last 3 weeks.

- (2h) Fifth, Analyse the quality of the product pages for informational copy, features, benefits & unique buying reasons. Collect these.

- (^) Sixth, Google Lens Hunt for Visual Content.

- (1h) Seventh, talk with you supplier if they have something like this in stock. The products have to resemble as good as possible. Otherwise your After-Sale issues will make your life complicated.

- Final Step, If you have the OK from your supplier + you give yourself the OK to sell (think critically if this product could sell before you set up everything) 

then you have a new project!

Bon chance. Well, exactly what I am trying to get you guys some products suitable for dropshipping with proven demand.

You can take a look at my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dropship/comments/1gkak8u/i_made_a_bot_to_track_ecom_advertisers_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) to see if it can help you out. If there was a way, do you think it would be shared here? 

Learn your tools, do your research and have a business plan.

This has worked for the 5 successful businesses I‚Äôve had. I skimped on research on one business venture and it failed, the other failure was not having a business plan.

So 5 out of 7 isn‚Äôt bad. I have one active business now (number 7) and working out my marketing on my ecomm business (number 8); too early to tell if it‚Äôll sink or swim, but I did 6 months hard research and have a solid business plan in place. That's what i find the most challenging. 
And even if you find a segment, you need to think of a strategy. Just ads are not something a low budget can afford. You need to think of a way to pack and show the product from a different perspective.

I'm not an expert or something. I'm trying to launch a woocommerce website myself and start dropshipping. I just can't find a better way to show off my products to potential buyers. I know you have mentioned this in your post, but look at whats trending. Not on the surface level. At every video, come up with an idea. i am working on a store for this right now but ill let you in on a great idea. I keep on seeing brainrot so here is the idea i came up with.

Brainrot is trending right now. Skibidi, gyat, sigma, alpha. 

Dropship trophies of bums that say GYAT of the year 2024, with someones name on it. It is by far the silliest thing, and quite frankly a stupid thing, but these brainrot words are something Gen Z see daily and silly products like this can get a lot of impulse purchases, especially around christmas/black friday. We aren't in it together though...you're literally the competition. Out of interest, how are you searching for new products on TT?  What keywords are you using to search? how I do product research is first start with a niche, the dive deeper into the niche and find a sub niche, niche with in a niche, Then once I settle on the niche, i do a deep dive into the target market of said niche. your brand/store what ever is going to live and die by these folk so you need to know as much as you can. Chatgpt is really good for this kind of research. THEN i start to look for products. I use a combination of Google trends, google key word planner to help give me ideas of what my target market is searching for. I then hop on to amazon (I do not use amazon as a source) I start looking at the reviews. I then hop to AliExpress  and start looking for similar prices and i check to see how many have been sold and reviews. I also do a search online for my niche and suppliers. So say you want to start selling watches. I would do a google search for Watch (what ever type of watch your interested in selling)  dropship suppliers. And start looking though that list to see if they have products that my target market would be interested in selling.  

Remember its not about what YOU want or what YOU like, unless you are part of your target market. Its about what your target market wants.

Now another thing while I am on my soap box. Stop going with a broad audience when running ads.  That is a waste of money. Remember this not everyone is your customer. I will use myself as an example. I am a fat 48-year-old hairy pasty white man.  Lets say you are selling women's cocktail dresses. The kind with a slit all the way up to hip tight fitting body con style. And you decided to run a broad ad say 18 to 65 no interests. Well guess what your negative persona., me, gets to see your ad because the social media platform goes broad. Now say I accidently click on your ad, or out of curiosity i click on the ad. I have now wasted both your money as well as fucked up your data. Trust me no one wants to see my hairy ass in a black backless sexy number with my white leg that hasn't seen sun light in over 40 years sticking out!!  So before you start looking for products deep dive on your niche of choice THEN start looking for products.  have you tried poking around Reddit itself?  have you tried poking around Reddit itself?  have you tried poking around Reddit itself? Do some actual market research. If you're trying to sell popular tiki tok products, you're just one of the many in the same rat race. 

The game is price arbitrage, so you have to use your research and judgement to spot products that may sell well, aren't saturated in the market, and you can turn over for a good margin. 

There's no magic bullet, if there was, drop shipping would be even more saturated and overdone than it already is Get a shared account, pay $100 one time, no subscription and you have access to many product research tools like minea or Pipi ads adspy etc. 

Then just simply look for the best products in small regions in the last week. 

As for the shared account thing. I can help u get it. I know a guy good point I just scroll and like product ads that are run by dropshippers to get more of em

Or I usually just search up a tag like ‚ÄúTikTok made me buy it‚Äù then look at recent videos

But like I mentioned, the algorithm goes insane and starts giving me advertisements about random AI tools and softwares that will ‚Äúhelp me grow my business‚Äù Do the opposite to this.  Try searching using keywords related to particular niches you are interested in.  If you want products that are eco friendly, search it as an example.",2024-11-05 20:58:12

\* More active ads does not equal more sales, but I include only advertisers with 30+ ads, which should be enough to prove they are doing quite well.

Please [con",useful,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropship/comments/1gkak8u/i_made_a_bot_to_track_ecom_advertisers_on/,I made a bot to track e-com advertisers on Facebook that are spending big money. (Updates),"In the previous [version](https://www.reddit.com/r/dropship/comments/1eqawqc/i_made_a_bot_to_track_ecom_advertisers_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), it only returns winning advertisers who are placing many ads without further filter for products for dropshipping. That means you still need to spend quite some time to screen the products.

But now, on top of those winning advertisers, it can do background research and retrieve the products that are likely suitable for dropshipping, i.e. lightweight, small and solves a problem.

[Here](https://ibb.co/ZXXPdMw) is how it looks like.

# Sample E-commerce sites

Here are some samples of the winners you can have a look. (Please search the store yourself)

**Store name: GroundingWell**

Current active ads: 2500 in US

Summary by bot:¬† The website sells GroundingWell‚Ñ¢ Bedsheets and GroundingWell‚Ñ¢ Mats designed to provide grounding or earthing benefits for improved health and wellness during sleep and daily activities.

**Store name: Peak Footwear**

Current active ads: 400 in US

Summary by bot:¬† The website sells barefoot shoes designed for comfort and health, featuring good arch support, slip-resistant, and waterproof options for various seasons.

**Store name: ScalpHero**

Current active ads: 50 in US

Summary by bot: The website sells the HeroEpilator‚Ñ¢ Facial Hair Remover for painless facial hair removal and the ScalpHero‚Ñ¢ Smart Scalp Massager for promoting hair health and stress relief.

# My thoughts on using data:

\* You can just target similar audience to share the pie

\* You can target different audience in other ways to sell these proven products to more customers

\* Target to your own country in your local language

\* More active ads does not equal more sales, but I include only advertisers with 30+ ads, which should be enough to prove they are doing quite well.

Yup",success,concern,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropship/comments/1gictq1/how_much_budget_do_you_need_for_dropshipping_in/,How much budget do you need for dropshipping in India? ,"Finally after thinking and procrastinating a lot you decided to start dropshipping in India.¬†  
India is an emerging market. The big advantage is that it‚Äôs new for dropshipping. The competition is less.¬†  
This is the right time to start.¬†

But the biggest question that comes to your mind is how much budget you need for dropshipping in India.

Before I answer that you need to know in India there are two models of e-commerce.¬†  
1¬†. Inventory Model  
2¬†. Dropshipping Model

**Inventory Model**  
In the inventory Model, you keep the stock in your warehouse and you pack and ship it by yourself. You are responsible for stock management.¬†  
The advantage of this model is a high margin and more control.¬†  
The disadvantage is that it takes lot of work and effort and not everyone can do it.¬†

**Dropshipping Model**  
In this model, you receive the order from the customer and you place the order to dropshipping suppliers.¬†  
The advantage is you don‚Äôt have to manage the stock and shipping.  
The disadvantage is you don‚Äôt have control over delivery time and the margin is low.¬†

*Let‚Äôs get to the budget*

**Inventory Model**  
To test a product you buy it from suppliers first. Let‚Äôs say you buy 10 Pieces and each one can cost you around 100 to 300 rupees. You run Facebook ads for the same product which might cost you around 500 to 2000. So total cost can be from 2000 to 5000 just to test the product.¬†  
Assuming you test at least 10 products. before you find your first winner. It will cost you around 20k to 50k.¬†  
The story doesn‚Äôt end here. You also have to see if it is profitable in the long run. Because of RTO not every product is profitable.  
You have to repeat the process until you find a product that has less RTO and more profit.¬†  
Assuming you tested among 5 winning Products if it is profitable or not. You will have to spend roughly 1Lakh to 2.5 lakh.¬†  
However there is a way you don‚Äôt have buy products upfront while testing, that is the story for later.¬†

**Dropshipping Model**  
In this model, the majority of the money goes to Facebook ads. We will test a few products until we find a product we are getting good sales. We have to let it run and see if it is profitable. You have to at least 10k for a specific product in Facebook ads and calculate if it‚Äôs profitable or not.¬†  
The same process will repeat for at least 5 to 7 products.

Don‚Äôt forget the shopify subscription, your store will be active at least 5 months before you see profit. It can be less also.¬†

The budget you will need is 10k for shopify, 60k for Facebook ads (50k + 10k GST) and another 15k just find the product that is giving us sales.¬†  
The total is 85k is the minimum amount you need for the dropshipping model.¬†","**REPORT posts/comments if they are SPAM, self-promotion, or a store review/critique**

Go for it and you‚Äôll find out. Do you but, I personally think Its too late to ramp up a new store especially a seasonal one mid-Q4 of 2024.  
  
Think about the time it takes to finish your site, get your samples from overseas, shoot the ads, have all the accounts up and a fresh pixel warmed up for ur audience.

Also, your CPA will be high because of all the marketers spending this time of year raising the bid costs.  
  
I usually pause my store in early dec to make absolutely sure my customers get their gifts in time. Your shipping times will be too slow to get your product to your customer in time for Xmas.

Hope this helps brother üìàüìà I have some products you might be able to sell! Hey! Your plan for a seasonal gift shop sounds promising. Here are a few quick tips:

1. **Research**: Even if products aren't trending, ensure they have appeal. Use tools like Google Trends to gauge interest.
2. **TikTok Strategy**: Posting five TikToks daily is ambitious! Focus on engaging content that showcases product benefits.
3. **Product Quality**: Choose 10-15 high-quality items that resonate with your audience. Unique features can help them stand out.
4. **Website**: Ensure your site is user-friendly, mobile-optimized, and visually appealing. High-quality images and clear descriptions are key.
5. **Ads**: Use your Facebook ad experience to target the right audience effectively. Test different approaches to see what works best.

Stay adaptable and gather customer feedback after launch. Good luck!

  
If you need I can build you a FREE store, all I as it's a review in return. [removed] I was thinking about the exact same idea yesterday and i bumped into your post today. And I also have experience with running ads for my dad's business, but not really a dropshipping experience yet. Similarities in the story are insane. understood i believe in it 100% i have vision for it. my only concern is do i have be to safe and find trending products or be ambitious and find amazing products that r not trending really? i tried looking for stores with christmas products and there is barely any stores doing good right now simply because most of them are very low effort. i feel like i could right in i mean if i order some products by tonight they would be here in 7 days i guess then i can spend 5 days shooting content and post it the entire month of november and december. i‚Äôm trying to products with fairly quick shipping like 7-14 days isnt bad. yes im basically going to turn into a gift shop with new drops every week. but im also going to update its theme and stuff every season and add seasonal/ festive products dm Do you build them or do you just take what ChatGPT tells you.. lol Sorry, that's just so obviously written by ChatGPT it's just funny XD thank you so much that is what im going with. Forget about trending products. You can sell any products in November and December. Without asking you what you‚Äôre planing to sell I was just generalizing and pointing out the time crunch and hurdles to get up and running.

I just think it depends what your selling. People usually buy Christmas decorations early from a Home Depot or Walgreens, not online and not too close to Christmas.

And if ur thinking of selling a projector I would skip. Too saturated. You haven‚Äôt found any stores with Christmas products because it‚Äôs October most retailers don‚Äôt even put out their Christmas products until after thanksgiving Reddit says I can't for some reason lol thank you so much for that. i‚Äôm proceeding. not only christmas stuff of course like just all sort of seasonal stuff like winter gadgets such as fog lights, snow tools, warmers and then i can keep changing my products every season while also having a space for trending products in the market You ever leave your house? Good Lord, they had Christmas stuff in stores since October 10th. We just went for another box of treats for the kids coming by and there's not a single halloween thing left in the local grocery stores, and we went to all 4 lol It's all Christmas now lol. Been like that since like.. as long as I could walk by myself. I legitimately can't tell if this comment is a joke lol. 

That all said, I agree with most everyone here, a seasonal shop right now just isn't that smart. Unless you are an absolute marketing genius, you won't make enough money and then people will be complaining about late packages. But also, you do you. If this is what you want to do. Just do it. 

Don't come to this reddit group asking people. They will shut you down with negativity at every step of the way lol And why wouldn't they?

Your anecdotal Halloween candies are cute but still my point is that OP was too early because it was still Halloween. I‚Äôve spent the last decade in retail things may have changed but I‚Äôm confident on the timeline of rolling out new products It's not anecdotal. It's quite factual. Stores have had christmas stuff out since before Halloween. They always start christmas stuff like 2 weeks to three weeks before halloween is even over. I don't know what retail you've been in for 10 years. But in Canada, this is how it's always been. 

And EVERY year it's the same thing. People complaining about christmas stuff being out too early. Maybe it's different in the US then? But it's not here in Canada. That said, I do see you specifically said after Thanksgiving, so meaning the US for you, since Thanksgiving is usually around the 12th for Canadians.",2024-10-29 16:44:43

The biggest problem I see beginners face is they build a store, run ads and they either get no sales or little sales. Then they have no idea what the next step is. 

There are so many changes that can be made but they have no idea what change to make because they don't understand what the problem is.

It will require some patience and will be something you get better at with experience and every situation is different so there is no exact answer. The more unprofitable your store is the bigger the change you'll need to make.

I recommend using Shopify with DSers to automate your fulfilment process with AliExpress. It wasn't difficult for me to become profitable as I had built a branded niche dropshipping store. I was confident that I would make sales because of my products, niche, website and ad creatives. This was 4 years ago and I still run this store. This isn't really a direct answer to your question but I think I have the perfect solution for you.

You're just starting out on your journey and you probably lack the prerequisite skills needed to create killer marketing and advertising campaigns that drive sales like crazy.

I'm a freelance copywriter and I have the prerequisite skills needed to create killer marketing and advertising campaigns that drive sales like crazy. But I'm still trying to build a portfolio.

So why don't we just work together.

It's a win win situation.

You get a service that would normally cost you +/- $1000 monthly or would take you months to learn on your own. And you get it completely for free.

And I get the chance to build a portfolio and further improve my craft.

I'll worry about marketing, you'll worry about other functions of the business. And you get to reap all the benefits. All I want is the chance to build a portfolio.

In terms of the website, it does look pretty clean and layout is consistent. But I'd turn away as soon as I see the countdown. Imo it's too gimmicky. 

Also, definitely include an about us page and link to your socials. How do we know if the store is run by an actual person? Without socials, it looks to me like someone's going for a quick buck and run off. Honestly the website isn't THAT bad, but the reviews definitely are lol. Customers would not be mentioning your product with perfect grammar and branding in every review. The problem is most likely with your ads, not the landing page. 1. Show the product in action.
2. Remove fake reviews. You either need to create some unique images or use a Shopify app to disable right clicking because I seen your exact product on Amazon. A lot of customers price check and will do this and will impact your conversion rate. All your reviews are similar, even the 1 star reviews say the product is great? That'd make me back out of buying it **REPORT posts/comments if they are SPAM, self-promotion, or a store review/critique**

Is not a significant amount of money at all for running ads

>portable espress machine 

There‚Äôs also a typo on your second sub header

Your site looks okay, but a singular landing page in [modern day] is kind of lazy and your brand isn‚Äôt established so I‚Äôd just order off amazon 5 days for urgency? One of your images doesn‚Äôt properly appear‚Äîthe top is missing‚Äîand 2 of your 1-star reviews are really positive, which is a bit of a red flag to me. Overall, your site is pretty good if you ask me, but the reviews need to be fixed. A few more products and the ability to add upsells would also be a good idea, along with features to improve conversions, like email pop-ups for discounts, etc. Whats your product? This product has been beaten to death for about 10 years. This is NOT a good product. Out of how many sessions did you get 3 add to carts? Also I saw someone mention the countdown may be the problem, I personally don‚Äôt see anything wrong with it. I understand what they‚Äôre saying in terms of it being gimmicky but it doesn‚Äôt mean that it wouldn‚Äôt work. I use it and it works really well for me! How does one get so many reviews? Too many variables to say anything right now. 

Would you be open for a 20 min session I can get a better idea? This sub really is how to scam 101. Y'all are a cancer to society where is the video of it being used? For sure, I can start working on an actual about us page, but is connecting socials even if i'd have 0 followers a good idea? What do I do in that regard?

Second, I'll totally try removing the timer and seeing if that has an impact.

I just tried to copy paste my fb data and stuff and it didn't look right, and I tried to do an image and it doesn't let me lol Do I need to run more ads? Because I only use assets from my website in the ads and descriptions etc are all standard as it seems to me The one I see on amazon is more expensive, but I could be wrong or doing it wrong. Do you have an shopify apps that disable right-clicking that you would reccomend? And is there an app I can add to see if people actually do that? Totally understand, although I am undercutting 99% of things on amazon by a margin, could I ask what pages you'd suggest I add? 

Obviously an about us page, but other than that I wasn't sure what to add so I just ended up doing a single page. If I only have one product, should I have a different homepage and then this as a product page? Should the landing page go here or to the homepage? And what other pages should I include? Appreciate the feedback! I just wanted it to actually make sense, aligning with the end of October, but if that's not effective/it won't work I've tried removing it then I'll try adding a different, lower countdown :) Also I just checked your website, I‚Äôll have to say it looks great!! Looks like a genuine coffee company so congrats on that. Haven‚Äôt seen many websites on this sub where I can say they would get sales, but yours looks great! One thing is you can make your cart slide in from the right rather then landing the customer straight to the cart page. Also make the compare at price visible on the cart as well, you can use ‚ÄúCartly Slide Cart Drawer‚Äù for that. Another factor that you could improve on is making it a multiple product store all related to coffee. That way you don‚Äôt have to rely on having to sell one product but you can test out other ones as well. Based on what I‚Äôm seeing the problem is not fully the website, but I also need an answer to my previous question of how many sessions you have gotten. Agreed, countdown timers are an instant turn off.. of course they work on some but there are other ways to convey urgency.. looks like the countdown was gone when i visited your site üëå, which looked very good.. only suggestion i have is to move the reviews up above the FAQ's and about us paragraph. since socialproof is so important..  Whats your daily ad budget for an $80 product? How long have you ran Ads - was $100 spent over 7 days? I'm also new to paid ads - it took about 2 weeks before i got my first sale, with a daily budget per ad @ 20% of my products asking price \[$40\]. You need to be running video ads that showcase your products. Like send this to 5+ UGC creators who will make you lots of footage, b-roll, and whatever content you need to then make ads with. 

Image ads might work in some circumstances, but if you don't have video ads going right now you're trolling.

Standard isn't good, standard is bad. Your product, ads, and website need to stand out from other dropshippers, Amazon, etc. You want whoever sees your ad to think ""wow that's unique"" and then click through onto your website.

You also need some offer on your page, like a bundle or something. Check competitors. I didn't compare pricing but customers will and even if yours is cheaper than Amazon customers are familiar with Amazon and trust it and know they'll get fast shipping so they may prefer that even if it's more expensive. 

There are a ton of free Shopify apps that prevent right clicking they all do the same thing. There are expensive tools that can track your users activity on your site but that's probably not worth it for a new store.

I have a ton of free content on my website Dropshipping Hustle if you need help. Thank you so much for the advice! I'm just trying out removing the bar for a day or two to see how it works out, will def add a slide cart and I've wanted a way to show the discount in the cart as well. So I will totally do that. As for the sessions to cart, I now have 368 sessions with 3 add to carts. All my pixel data is scewed up though I might have to restart because more than half have been from reddit lol. For sure, I will check it out. I have no idea what UFC creators are though, and im not trying to troll but no I'm not running video ads üò≠üò≠ but my product has some great videos from manufacturer so I will add those.

I will for sure work on the creatives, but is there a way to pay someone not necessarily off Fiverr to make some for cheaper? I'm not looking to spend a lot but I could spend some as long as their reputable.

I'm planning to expand the store to multiple products but I've just had such a shit experience with dropshipping this is my 4th store (I've done 2 single product and 2 with more) and all of them have done 0 sales so I want to make sure the product is good before I expand, unless you believe it's essential (I just want to see some proof of concept dropshipping works)

https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLep-t3wpCPkWSJcyYiFsELQGLn-wzALvX&si=NAc1csVXnsJgwEXB Having multiple products and testing them is a good way to be able to find your winner. Just one is limited unless you have a really innovative and branded product. Niche store with products is preferred. They both have advantages and it really depends on the type of product or niche you're selling. I wrote an article on this exact subject if you're interested. [One vs multiple product store](https://www.dropshippinghustle.com/one-vs-multiple-products/) Unless your one-product is evergreen and caters to the masses, you will see sales drop off seasonally which isn't good for business.

But if you try out* multiple products in a defined niche, you have more headroom for experimenting and finding a winning product/products/category.

Also, if you want, we can get on a free consultation call to give you better insights. Selling one product in a store is a little bit risky. What if doesn't sell? You will have to redesign the store with new products and collections.

Since you have already found a niche that is Home Appliance and also found products in this niche, then a niche store would be a better option for you. It also gives you an opportunity to test various products in the same niche. Even doing branding of your store around that niche will be easier for you. I wouldn't invest in a one product store, but what about a one product campaign, wherein a landing page is dedicated to one product? I'd suggest going with a multi-product store, since your items are all in the home appliance niche. This approach gives you flexibility and can help with cross-selling, which often leads to higher average order values. Plus, if one product doesn‚Äôt resonate, you‚Äôve still got other options in the store to draw in customers.  I would list multiple products on your website because it builds credibility. A store with only 1-5 products is kind of sketchy looking in my opinion. Maybe aim for 10+ products on your store and advertise the one you think would do best. If it doesn't do well, you can still keep it on your store but just move on to the next product to actively advertise.

Just make sure the products make sense together. Home appliances is such a broad category so try to niche down as much as you can. Focus on a specific room in the house, vibe, age, gender, etc. To test I advise you to create a multiple products store. In fact i can help you create your dropshipping store for free.

I don't know where really to begin. 

Second is marketing. I understand that I gotta post videos daily at around the same time everyday and be consistent. My issue though is I don't have the money to just buy multiple products that are going to take 2-3 weeks to get here if not more, and I also have a cheap samsung that doesn't that doesnt have great video quality. Which means I need to scour the Internet and put a few videos together of my product and I'm not sure which video editing apps to go with. Finally someone doing good deeds for free. Does size matter?

The changes they did are great for dropshippers tho, there was nothing problematic about the updates. Western Europe is great but the problem is that there are a lot of individual markets and I prob","good, great, success","bad, problem, issue",,,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropship/comments/1ga5ohw/drop_shipping_is_probably_going_to_cooked_in_the/,Drop shipping is probably going to cooked in the next 6 months.,"Yesterday, I saw a video about some latest developments in dropshipping. It says that in the next 6 months it will not be legally and economically viable to dropship products from China to the US. It said that the De Minimis rule is getting scrapped. Here is how it said its gonna affect dropshipping. 

* From 6 months on from now sellers will have to pay customs duties but they also have to pay tariffs for every shipment no matter how small the packaging.
* As a dropshipper, you will have to reveal the buyer who is claiming the de minimis exemption and that means you have to give the buyer's social security number. When you dropship to US as a business, you need to give your EIN at the clearance. I personally do think no customer will want to give out their social security number considering the rising fraud cases in US. This is definitely going to kill dropshipping. 
* After the implementation of the law, you are required to submit the certificate of safety compliance at the port of entry or customs. I'm not sure if it must be done by Aliexpress or the dropshipper himself. 

What do you guys think about this development? Do you guys think dropshipping especially from China is cooked for ever. Experienced dropshippers plzz comment.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* Cooked, no chance!  More challenging, potentially.  This for me makes it more exciting, the tougher it is to trade in a particular market, the less competition.

If you think otherwise, business is not for you. This is one reason I drop ship from the USA. I filter aliexpress to show only ‚Äúship from USA‚Äù. It helps shipping times also. Their prices might go up but at least I‚Äôm not stuck with the customs details.

Also, FWIW, businesses change all the time, no matter the industry. What matters is how you respond/stay ahead. Dropshiping =/= dropshipping from china I doubt it'll happen and if it does there will always be a way around it. Part of me hopes it does because it will result in less competition and more opportunities. I think OP will open his mind more after positng this and seeing all these comments. Good news for Chinese sellers This is good news for me. I am setting up a 3PL company in Michigan.

This will allow people from outside of the United States to locate their products in my warehouse, and I will complete the shipping to the US customer from within the United States, which will avoid all of these restrictions. 

I‚Äôm basically competing with Amazon. Rather than a percentage, I am offering a flat rate for warehouse space. And a small additional charge on top of standard U.S. shipping.

So for me, this is very good news. I‚Äôm sorry for everybody else‚Äôs lost, but you‚Äôre going to have to find a way to logistically sidestep the restrictions and to look for loopholes. Curious too! Nobody that looks into the coming changes for both US and EU beyond surface level would really think its ""cooked"".

>I personally do think no customer will want to give out their social security number considering the rising fraud cases in US.

There is no need for them to give this out. Absolutely agree! I've been following this for the Sellify Club newsletter and almost every week, there's one thing or the other that puts the nail in the coffin of the dropshipping business model. 

\- First it was the EU's version of de minimis (150Euro threshold) being scrapped

\- Then the US legistlation

\- Then South Africa introduced a 20% VAT levy

\- Then TEMU posted 40% revenue growth, attracting IPO investors üòÖ

  
Would be interesting to see how it all plays out. Personally, I think the laws will curb dropshipping but like I've always said, true merchants will find a way to adapt. They will divest into 3PLs, print-on-demand industry  and source goods from places like Etsy like I've done in the past. For the 100,000,000,000 time, drop shipping is a logistics principle where a brand have contract with a supplier to ship units on demand without having to build up an inventory for the purpose of testing the market in the goal of finding a winning product to build a brand around it.

You can do dropshipping with US, Chinese, european, indian, middle eastern, african suppliers that are willing to do it the drop shipping way.

What many people fail to understand is that consumers are becoming more aware of dropshipping from china and they are extra careful when buying from websites or brands they‚Äôve never heard of.

If you sell them shitty quality don‚Äôt expect to build a great brand of it. it's just like the current Europe I am hoping this is to target big giants like Temu and Shein which is still using this loophole to make money. Usually when things get too big government notices and change rules to get a piece of the pie. 
Praying this is not to target small businesses. But like all the others say there is always a way around things, I‚Äôm sure we will adapt and so will the seller. Any YouTuber who says ""X is cooked!"" is an idiot...unless it's a cooking channel :)

As u/mmccccc correctly said, ""dropshipping"" is NOT the same thing as ""dropshipping using Chinese suppliers"". There's thousands of US-based suppliers you can get your products from, and there's many other countries from which you can get products from for your stores besides China.

The dropshipping model has been around since the days of Sears, Roebuck and Company, at least. It's not going anywhere. Don't believe the fearmongering BS. The winners will always find a way to win. US is not the only country you can dropship to... It's the hardest market anyway. Give a try to western Europe, you'll have more chance to succeed But I think this type of business model will still exist, that is, the economic model of drop shipping or one-piece delivery, because the market demand exists. In fact, I think even if you join a large platform similar to the Amazon FBA model, or the overseas warehouse model, it will still involve customs clearance and tariff issues. At present, the United States and the European Union have been reviewing Chinese export products in real time, but the sellers are still suffering. I think they will design a minimum sales volume to pay tariffs. It is impossible that a small package of 9.99 US dollars will also require you to pay a 2 US dollar import tax... Of course, if it really happens, I feel that it does not seem to be an abnormal event. Link to video please. PS: Now you only need to register IOSS or OSS in the name of your company to pay taxes, and you don‚Äôt need give the  EIN. Share the link please Is this in the UK or Europe? people who are upset about increased difficulty in a field are likely those who are at the bottom of the curve. U.S. is not the only country on earth where customers exist. SMH. This is always the common theme with newcomers. Haven't made a single sale and get all bogged down with future potential hazards. Focus on making 1 sale. Then 10. Then 100. Then 1,000. After THAT, if you want to think about doom and gloom then you're free to do so. But you wouldn't. Because you're so focused on your business, you ain't got time to think about all the negative stuff. So yeah.. stop worrying about all the problems in the game and figure out how to make your FIRST DOLLAR What if we ship it to ourselves first, as in you have your own little warehouse, and then ship it to the seller? I know that's not really dropshipping, but I was wondering if that was a potential way to circumvent these changes.

Also, is there a set date for when these changes are supposed to take place? This is only going to affect people dropshipping junk from China. People with real B2B deals won't be affected.

How I see this affecting the market is it is going to make e-commerce have a higher barrier of entry, but also improve the industry as a whole. People will either have to purchase their own product and vet its quality, or work with someone who has done QC for them. I would welcome both of these because it will make the e-commerce industry more lucrative and a better experience for customers. That is actually great news because this will immediately eliminate all of the low self-esteem guys who don't know how to make things work. You don't have to ship from China to dropship you just make more of a profit if you do. US 3PL? I don't think the USA will destroy a gold mine in tax revenue. Someone said prices will price 20-25% at least. If china has less business connection to us, it might provoke them to do dumb stuff as well. It‚Äôll just switch to more USA based dropshipping Incorrect The US (largest importer of goods) not being able to receive goods due to harsher regulations on receiving imports from china(largest exporter of goods) the worlds largest consumer is the united states even the largest corporations responsible for a percentage of our economy receive goods from china. 

Im curious do we think we will be self sufficient? are we assuming people other than ourselves personally will take care of these issues? The US never fails to make things way worse than they already are üòÇ One can only hope This will never happen, not sure why everyone arguing lol. Tell me you have no idea what dropshipping is without telling me Correct. When demand is UP that means business is GOOD. Like they are going to close millions of factories and ecommerce sites. What the government wants is A SLICE OF THAT PIE and they have tried for years and years. Of course you just have to find a way around the restrictions. That‚Äôs business. well said.

The changes they did are great for dropshippers tho, there was nothing problematic about the updates. Western Europe is great but the problem is that there are a lot of individual markets and I probably will have to redesign website and ad creatives that would cater to each one of them. I hope that I'm wrong. They might not have a problem closing those factories if they are Chinese. I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs the entire point. I made my own site, yes - and it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it could be a better performance üòÖ but what I said is still accurate üòÖ No 


I drop ship from US manufacturers. 

All the gurus have created this ideology that dropshipping only means buying products from Ali express‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt.

And china is only responsible for 15% of US imports, there is still the other 85% that nobody in this sub ever thinks about‚Ä¶ plenty of possibilities outside of Ali 

just need to get out of the echo chamber to realize these changes mean nothing. I'm in the egg stage of dropshipping, but I saw the same video and almost gave up before even starting, but the insight from the comments on this thread really give me back my peace of mind and hope I don‚Äôt really need to do that. One hundred customers would make me very happy. A lot of people don‚Äôt want to give up 30% of their sales just to participate with Amazon .

I know that I didn‚Äôt. You can store as many products as you can fit on the shelf for between $125 and $150 per month. I charge between two and three dollars over standard US shipping prices. Also, there is another aspect of competition where in some people just don‚Äôt like Amazon and don‚Äôt want to spend their dollars with them.

I am one of those people I‚Äôm curious about what market you‚Äôre in? All of what you mentioned is solved by sending packages bulksplit (like most already do to reduce costs).

Instead of sending lets say 500 packages from China to buyers in the US, its sent as one shipment into the US and then they split it up into 500 shipments after its imported.

This cuts costs/paperwork and they are getting it as a domestic shipment.

That way its the company importing it and not the person ordering it, and no need for their import information etc.  
Aliexpress like you mentioned already does this for most countries. So what? Clone and translate your current stores and ads, it's not that hard... I advise you to try targeting the Dutch market (NL & BE targeting Dutch speakers), or the Scandinavian market (NO, SE, FI). You just need to clone your initial store, translate (store and ads), put the right currency, and add the right payment options to each store (Ideal for Dutch and Klarna for Scandinavia). Good luck I really doubt you know the power of sales and the Chinese people XD. Makes no sense to have someone give their EIN or SSN: it is one of those ""laws"" that will never pass for being way too dumb. The US NEEDS Chinese goods since like 50000 years ago. Whoa‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure if I believe that. Gonna google wow, guys a random post got the most upvotes so far. appreciate the info. Maybe google before you comment? 

Google will tell you that the US imported 3.9T last year. 

600B was from china. 

That is about 15.3%.

Plus or minus a few % depending on the year.

Mexico is quickly catching up to china as companies move their manufacturing operations back to North America. Last year was the first year that china was not the #1 source of US imports‚Ä¶ Mexico claimed the title with 16%‚Ä¶ beating China by only a few tens of billions. 

Soon as the US punches a railroad through Mexico will be the new China. ""Maybe google before you comment"" lol calm down little guy, I wasn't attacking you. It was an interesting statement that I said I wasn't sure on and I was going to google for more info. Have you thought about many such ‚ÄúMexico co‚Äù are just shadow companies importing from China and then reselling into US? It only increases prices to the end consumers‚Ä¶lol ‚ÄúLittle guy‚Äù 

Lol, so you‚Äôre a child. All makes sense now.

I wasn‚Äôt attacking you either, you sure got riled up over it though Sure, some are.. that‚Äôs not the point though 

Are you disagreeing that companies are moving their manufacturing operations to Mexico? haha Like I said, I saw an interesting topic and I made a comment and you came off like a douche bag. I'm not riled up at all :) Have a great day and I hope you run into someone who can adjust that attitude for you some time. I‚Äôm sure that some are really moving factories to Mexico, but it sounds like you believe that it‚Äôs a major trend. Data can be misleading and many business flows are off the book. We can disagree and don‚Äôt have to persuade each other^_^ I came off like a douche bag? Ok bud. Whatever you say bud.

I didn‚Äôt insult you, you insulted me. Ie, you got riled up. 

Keep taking that T, it‚Äôs doing wonders for your temper. 
Nobody is importing 500b  into Mexico just to turn around and export it to the US. What an idiotic take.

Imports are public record. We know exactly how much product flows into and out the country, as well as its country of origin. How exactly is that ‚Äúmisleading‚Äù? 

(And before you say it, country of origin is defined as where the product is made, not which country the shipment originated from) 

I mean.. unless you‚Äôre suggesting the US Gov is lieing to us? . I‚Äôm not suggesting anything LOL
Not sure why you‚Äôre so emotionally arguing. 

With many years of experience in corporate data analysis, I learned that general data means nothing and drawing any generic conclusion from it ‚Äúcan be‚Äù misleading - I‚Äôm not saying ‚Äúis‚Äù. Data cannot lie but wrong analysis does happen more often than people think.

You used a generic import/export data to prove a ‚Äú manufacturing shift‚Äù - I don‚Äôt get it, not saying you are wrong but please tell me more. I always look at segmented data to ‚Äútry to‚Äù get the story.

What exactly industry segments or goods are we talking about? Electronics? Agriculture products? Clothes? And what are the major segments for e-commerce? Are those fast growing/exporting segments in Mexico matching those major e-commerce ones? What segments importing from China are declining or slowing down? Are these Chinese declining segments matching Mexico growing?

A simple test for me is to walk into any grocery store,  pick things up and check the labels. Do I see more things are made in Mexico than made in China? If so, i have no doubts you are right!

Too tired typing. I‚Äôm not going to respond to this thread any more. Thanks for the thought food. You wrote an essay about a whole lotta nothing. 

your argument is that the widely accepted consensus ‚Äúmight‚Äù be wrong??

Why don‚Äôt you argue global warming isn‚Äôt real while you‚Äôre at it. Numbers can be misleading after all.

While you‚Äôre at it, you should call up Union Pacific and tell them the trillions they spend expanding their rail lines from Mexico up to Canada was a waste and they are misinterpreting the data 

It‚Äôs all much more simple than you are making it out to be. Compare import records that originate from Mexico. Compare to import records that originate from China. Which number is bigger? Mexico? Looks like my comment is 100% correct. 

Again, there is no way to make that data ‚Äúsay something‚Äù. It‚Äôs not a complex conclusion and it‚Äôs not complex data.",2024-10-23 04:37:09

U got this üí™ üí™ Dropkeeping is the real deal bro I have a website called Dropshipping Hustle with a lot of free content from my own experiences with dropshipping. I also have an article about [how to do dropshipping if you're under 18](https://www.dropshippinghustle.com/dropshipping-if-youre-under-18/). Good luck. You can start totally free. As you say, you have lot of free time so keep research on Google & YouTube. Lot of sources, blog, videos are available on internet. You will get a better idea about dropshiping from there. Don't waste money at first. Good Luck!! I highly suggest building a following on social media first. I can help out, Dropshipping can actually help to get extra income that you can save up for that big dream. 

To start, I'd advise you do some research on products that would sell and its in high demand presently.. We can talk in DM if you don't mind what makes u say that? Love your stuff! [deleted] [deleted] i dont mind, thank you for your help Thank you, appreciate the love! clearly staged interaction Thank you for the vouch, glad you enjoy the videos and find them reliable!

Drop ship the items to your store? the fact you got this defensive only proved my point Have you looked at his profile or any of his other posts?? There‚Äôs like 3-4 links for his YouTube videos. He‚Äôs directing traffic.

Maybe do a little looking around before you boot lick. Dropship the items means, after you've completed your research for Hot selling products, check Dropshipping Partner websites with Shopify, integrate them with Shopify and integrate these products into your store. It doesn't take much time. 

That's where you'll add your Profit Margin, etc [deleted] i understand your scepticism but I feel like he's one of the few legit ones. he runs his own store for 4 years showing consistent sales, if you don't like his youtube videos you dont need to watch them. thats more trustable than someone who shows fake sales then sells a 5k course imo. And you think that the other guy isn‚Äôt also trying to sell OP on something much scummier than a video? Smh man. Directing traffic to your videos is 10x less shady than trying to sell your bootleg Indian ‚Äúexpert‚Äù marketing services to people who don‚Äôt know better. yeah ur probably just arguing with an alt account of the banana guy.

Good luck! You can still sell good quality products from China What is your budget? I know a direct sales company from China. If you can show me your online store, they can find the hot-selling products you want according to your needs and help you with the delivery without a minimum order quantity.

Here‚Äôs another idea to scratch the entrepreneurs itch. 

Consider buying another business like the one you own for $0 down payment. 

Banks love lending to business owners with direct business ownership experience in the field they are buying. 

The bank can issue an SBA ‚Äúexpansion‚Äù loan with no down payment. 

It‚Äôs not what you were asking about, but it‚Äôs another opportunity on the table for existing business owners that you should be aware of before you launch your new venture. I run an Operations Outsourcing company, so you know I'm gonna pitch something to you down the line lol.

So here's the thing:

Our experience has been that most, if not all of our clients who've grown to a certain size have found themselves to become an ""accidental employee"" of their own business.

If you've already got monthly recurring revenue, and have the businesses processes in place, now might be worth the time to explore outsourcing these repeatable tasks to an offshore team of wonderful, hardworking Filipinos with a neutral accent.

Getting an offshore team to do the repeatable tasks frees you up to pursue higher things - it could be an adjacent business or a totally new vertical, or you could focus on getting more clients.

I‚Äôm in the process of launching my own e-commerce brand, and I‚Äôm super excited to share that my first product is a bra. It's not a full lingerie or undergarment line (yet!)‚Äîjust one specific bra I‚Äôm working on. I‚Äôm currently getting quotes from manufacturers on Alibaba, and I‚Äôm really passionate about this product. My focus for this bra is to make it work seamlessly under most types of clothing. I‚Äôve noticed that many outfits require different bras, and I want to change that.

Of course, like any small business owner, I have some worries‚Äîfinancial concerns being my biggest one. I'm honestly terrified of investing a significant amount of money without a return, which is why I‚Äôm reaching out to you all! I have a few questions that would mean a lot to me if you could help with:

1. Would you ever wear a bra without trying it on first?
2. Would you consider buying a bra online from a small business?
3. If you found a bra you loved, even if you don‚Äôt currently need one, would you buy it anyway?
4. How important is it for you that bras work well under various types of clothing?
5. Would you change the bra you‚Äôre wearing if you saw the straps under your clothes?
6. Wire or wireless‚Äîwhat‚Äôs your preference?

Please help a sister out and share your thoughts with me! I‚Äôd really appreciate your input. üòä","1. yes if i have seen reviews about the product such as from micro influencers or even videos on the site just pictures aren't enough in this case 

2. yes actually i would assume the quality is better and more details 

3. yes because i love it and lets be honest a lot of us have bras that are years old that can be replaced so why not 

4. very important because i am not trying to buy a bra that i have to wear with a specific type i want something that just works. may i add that could be a get uvp 

5. yes and no depends on how much 

6. doesnt really matter 

maybe start vloging on social media and things like that to build a community and look to see what other small companies are doing for their marketing could also create an email list and keep them up to date with progress and make interactive polls. I was also wondering what is the hardest thing so far about starting your business? and what resources would you like to have? I am starting an entrepreneurship ed tech app that has gamified learning and ai mentorship that focuses on community ( like discussion posts and messaging) while also being inclusive and accessible. Knowing this would help me better figure out what potential users want! Thank you! 1. yes, i just hope either their letter sizing (S/M/L etc) or bra sizing is accurate and not like victoria‚Äôs secret

2. yes, i have

3. yes but i might not be actively looking if i don‚Äôt need one as i find bra shopping very annoying

4. fairly important but not so much that i think i would be your target market, i like a bit of bra show under some tops and just don‚Äôt wear strapless etc due to my boobs being DD

5. not if it was my black bra, i like that vibe; my other ones, yes

6. i own both and they have different uses

32DD   
1. Yes, I have done it before

2. Yes, if the quality is good 

3. No, I won't. 

4. Super important especially when I do not want others to see the bra straps

5. Yes, I always make sure I am wearing a strapless bra so it won't show in my clothes

6. Wire for support Rather than asking us, probably a good idea to ask your target market. IME, fellow entrepreneurs are more likely to understand and buy from other small businesses. Also, while you could eventually go broad with something like this, you probably want to start by interviewing/talking to those this would *most* appeal to first (my guess: younger, trendy, tend to wear a variety of outfits that have less coverage, probably average to smaller chested.)

Keep in mind, ""would you"" type questions don't tend to give accurate data because we're not great at predicting how we would behave in hypothetical situations. 

What I would do instead is 1. Ask your target market what they've done in the past (ie: ""*Have* you ever bought a bra without trying it on first?"") and 2. Consider creating a landing page for a waitlist. Really sell the benefits/pain points it solves and see how many people sign up. Also a great way to build your list and you can reach out to those people to interview them. It really depends on your target audience! But I'd say,

1. Yes, as long there are reviews

2. Yes if I see any reviews or content on it 

3. Sure 

4. Pretty important, I hate it when it shows under the shirt and I get upset that I can't wear some of my shirts without adjusting constantly

5.  Depends tbh

6. Wireless is more comfortable for me

3 Functional Fixedne",,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i5c278/how_to_make_people_buy_from_you_whenever_you_want/,How to make people buy from you whenever you want part 2,"Yo.

Let‚Äôs cut the fluff and dive straight into it.

Here are 7 triggers to make people buy from you!!

And before you roll your eyes and say, ‚ÄúWell, duh, this is obvious‚Äù‚Äîhold up. 

This post isn‚Äôt for everyone. It‚Äôs for those new to the game who need the basics. So pump the brakes, Charlie, and let‚Äôs dig in.

1 Reciprocity:
   Offer free stuff (yeah, we‚Äôve heard it before). But here‚Äôs the trick: offer free stuff, walk away, *then come back* with even more free stuff. This doubles the effect because it feels like you were genuinely thinking about them and wanted to add extra value.

2 Authenticity:
   People aren‚Äôt completely dumb (okay, not all of them). If you start bullsh*tting, they‚Äôll smell it from a mile away. Be real. Be authentic. It‚Äôs that simple.

3 Functional Fixedness:
   Humans tend to associate objects with one function only. Your job? Shatter that mindset. Show them how your product *redefines* its purpose and makes a real change in their life.

4 Consistency:
   The more you show up in front of your audience, the more familiar you become. Ever notice how a terrible song gets stuck in your head because it‚Äôs played nonstop? Same principle here. Keep showing up.

5 Anchoring:
   Present a sky-high price first‚Äîsomething 5‚Äì10x higher than your actual offer. It makes your real offer look like a steal. If someone bites on the high one? Sweet! If not, congrats, you just nailed your anchor.

6 Upsells:
   The best time to sell is right after someone‚Äôs already bought from you. Offer an add-on, upgrade, or complementary product while they‚Äôre still in buying mode. You‚Äôre 3x more likely to close that sale. Don‚Äôt let them walk away without trying.

7 Ditch the Need for Approval:
   Stop bragging on your landing page. Nobody cares about your awards, achievements, or the color of your boxers. Focus on what benefits them. If they can‚Äôt see the value, they‚Äôre out.

That‚Äôs it for today.

Thanks for sticking around.

See ya!",,2025-01-19 18:14:36

People always buy from and do business with people they like. Don‚Äôt ask another startup group member - ask someone (actually 10 people) that would be a prospective customers of each. It‚Äôs what they ","success, recommend","hard, avoid",,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i5awmh/business_owners_whats_one_piece_of_advice_youd/,Business owners: What's one piece of advice you'd give to someone wanting to start their own business?,Same as the question above: be raw and honest! ,"Everyone‚Äôs journey is different, but for me‚Ä¶

Do it, stop talking about it.

Be patient and consistent. Your customers are selfish. They don‚Äôt care about you, what you do, or why you do it. They don‚Äôt care about your story or your struggle. They care about what your product can do for them.

Make sure your product provides value and value ONLY. Don‚Äôt get a business partner. And if you do go over board on contract and operating agreements. Start small and start today. Start Network, network, network. With everyone you can think of. Work out of inspiration, not desperation.  What I mean is many wantrepreneurs spend so much time wondering how long it will take and focused so much on the end goal.  Build your business on a passion so you can enjoy it even when money is slow.   That's working with inspiration instead of focusing on the end goal only.

That doesn't mean you don't set goals. It means your primary focus is staying present and not getting lost in the comparison game, income expectations, etc.  Be sure there is a passion behind what you're doing and not just for the money.

For example, a mother starting a business because she was inspired by her daughter's Autism challenges is going to have a passion and fuel behind her that will make it more than just ""success"" or money."" She is working out of inspiration partially due to the passion of her daughter.

Most of my income streams have been inspired by personal things. Do your research. Ask for advice/help. It‚Äôs ok to mess up. Know your ""Why"" and remember it. Why are you in business, and what are you doing it for.¬†


There will be bad times, throw in the towel times. If you can reflect on your ""why"" it can drive hunger and the resilience often required. Don‚Äôt quit your day job. Use your income to fund your business. Quitting your job should be a milestone of your business. Not a requirement to start your business. Start small, think of your business as a baby. Take your time and don‚Äôt rush. Focus on understanding your customers gradually. The key is to survive first and then grow, not to grow while struggling to survive. Be prepared for the dip. That‚Äôs the months or years where it‚Äôs not working. Obsess over it. Spend every waking second thinking about it. It will get easier, but don't plan on that. Look up in 12 months and be surprised that it's easier. 

Sell sell sell. Oversell. Sell such a backlog of work that you can hire people to start doing the work for you. You need money in order to do anything, so sell so much that you have customers waiting to get their products and can afford to hire help to fulfill it. Research the cost of doing business. I‚Äôve seen some businesses, not even knowing how much their inventory was gonna cost once they got up and running. Realize that not everyone is your customer. Meaning, don‚Äôt lower your prices because they can‚Äôt afford your service. Be ready to fail ‚ÄúGive me 6 hours to cut down a tree and I will spend the first 4 sharpening the axe.‚Äù Get off Reddit. Start taking action. Join a company in the industry you want to pursue and immerse yourself in learning everything about it. Pay close attention to the specific pain points and challenges within the industry. Once you‚Äôve gained enough knowledge and experience, focus on solving those pain points and finding ways to monetize your solutions. That‚Äôs the best way to start a company imo Dedicated be dedicated First be an expert and be very good at what you do. Find a reliable stream of revenue that can support you and keep your expenses as low as possible. Do the highest priority tasks first and delegate non essential tasks to others. Make smart decisions and lean on your strengths. Learn about cash flow. Don‚Äôt get stuck in the opinions of others. Focus on building out your long term plan and executing. 1) Be consistent and patient. Building a business takes time, trust and knowledge. Make sure you are ready to wait it out.

2) Know your numbers. Make sure you track every penny you put into the business and what you're making. If after a year or two you realise you're just turning money, it's time to reflect and make changes. 

3) Don't listen to gurus online. Few of them have ever run a successful business and giving advice is their only source of revenue.

4) Respect your customer. Don't take them for granted and treat them with the respect they give you. They're trusting you with their hard-earned cash, so make sure you know what the hell you're talking about.

5) Only take advice from those who are more successful than you or are where you'd like to be. Ignore the noise around you (especially the negative comments). 

6) Make sure you build cash reserves. No cash = bankruptcy.

7) Pay yourself fairly but hire someone ASAP. Outsource all the tasks that are operational and are wasting your time. For example, I enjoy accounting but I wasn't the most efficient at it. It's now outsourced freeing up approximately 10 hours a month of my time to focus on sales and marketing.

8) Make sure you have a hobby. Building a business is a marathon and you need time away from it if you want to maintain sanity. Don't register until you're ready to trade Believe in yourself. In your ability to learn, to fight, and to win. Try to have fun and enjoy the work you do Dont.... Still want to? Dont... Oh you really really REALLY want to? Then go in 110% or Dont... you cant half ass a business Execute the bare bones idea and baby step your way up once you proved its viable/profitable.




Oh and if you hate constant stress. DO.NOT.DO.IT. Don‚Äôt quit your day job It‚Äôs not easy Do your own bookkeeping Sell quality at an affordable price and you'll never be short on customers. It‚Äôs all a bout the customer and providing value to them, solving a problem they have. Be laser focused on how you‚Äôre going to solve it and communicating that.¬† **. Define Your Vision**

* Know your purpose: What problem are you solving?

Set clear, realistic goals Don't quit your day job until you're able to replace your salary. Obsess about a great customer service and keep it simple. You don't need flashy offices or anything. Get started on your basement/garage/car it doesn't matter.

Learn everything you can. Understand your downside and come to terms with it before plunging in. This is fresh for me as I'm going to take my own leap of faith here soon, and I'm already at peace should the entire thing collapse.

Should it entirely blow up, I will still have a roof and I can still take care of my dependents and liabilities. 

Will take some time to recover for sure, but I will not be in foreclosure or filing bankruptcy. 

Contrast this mindframe with that of someone who massively overextended themselves and now HAS to make it work to survive. 

That's a pile of stress and anxiety that you don't want to deal with 24/7. That's a recipe for second guessing everything. The quality of your business decisions will be at a very degraded level when things don't go your way and you enter desperation mode. Know why you are doing it before you start doing it. I know it's popular advice to tell someone, ""Just Start"", but one of my mentors said to me, ""Why go unless you know where are you going?"" The best thing you can do it just start. Everyone has ideas. Many people are capable. But what‚Äôll set you apart is actually taking steps, daily, to working on your goal. Be obsessed. Validate your idea first!
Its the most important thing because once you get into it and start implementing it becomes a tunnel vision at times and you continue on the same path and once the MVP is out you realise that this is not what customers need!

This has been a personal experience, hence please validate the need of the idea before implementing Only do it if it‚Äôs a genuine passion. 
Hard times WILL happen. And you WILL need passion to get through it. Stop wanting and just do it. Do not get loans, start with bare minimum. Go to therapy first. Then if you still want to start a business go for it. It takes any new business time to grow or gain enough momentum for you to make enough money to do it full time. Start on nights and weekends. Let it evolve into a second full time job then make the decision to pursue it full time Don‚Äôt quit your day job. I‚Äôm looking to move into a house with some guys to start a new business or create a venture that brings us wealth. Kind of like how Elon musk and Alex hormozi started. Comment or message me if that sounds interesting to you. Thanks honestly if you are thinking about starting a business talk about i know people in comments like stop talking about it but you should literally talk to everyone. get feedback. not everyone is going to have good feedback you dont have to take all of it. 

second off you should never limit yourself till you have to. we all have the thing where we think we have to do something one way but we dont so dont limit yourself till you have to 

third find a problem not a product and then figure out if it is even worth pursing this again is where feedback is necessary because if you cant sell it and people dont want it you aint got nothin. It's literally blood sweat and tears. It's like entering a long dark cold winter. Control your emotion. Look at the big picture. Don't let day to day up and downs get you down. It take mental toughness to start,build and sustain a small business. It's very very hard. Above all never forget your prime product. Marketing and employees or anything that gets in the way of why you are in business drops one level. Buckle the f up Take your first year sales estimate and cut it in half You‚Äôll learn more by just doing it wrong 100 times than trying to get it to be perfect once. Do a /r/spinout not a stsrtup You have to work really hard. Probably block reddit! Figure out your direction and stay committed to it with focus and determination, instead of jumping from one idea to the next without a clear plan ""Find a need, and fill it"" 

My grandpa used to tell me this. He was like a 3x entrepreneur Always be looking for ways to improve the customer experience. And remember with every complaint is some feedback on ways you can do that. Definitely has been important for me when writing up product descriptions and managing buyer expectations. Always approach things from the customer's perspective Your product doesn't mean shit Be relentless in building and growing your business.  If you really want a shot at being successful. Find the customers first, then build. Do it only if you can afford to fail a few times and fallback on saved money or some other means just in case. Wake up as early as possible, you‚Äôre gonna procrastinate at first. The earlier you get up the more time you have left in the day to work after trying to kill your habit of procrastinating Make a solid, airtight business plan with clear short-term and long-term goals. Have it reviewed by several trustworthy, experienced business people for feedback. Don‚Äôt, it easier and smarter to get a job. Don‚Äôt Make a business in the ai industry. I think being impatient day to day helps. I want to get things done and move on to the next thing. Take this for example:

Charity organisations only work because they make the people donating to them feel good about themselves.

I can guarantee that if WaterAid didn‚Äôt make people feel good about donating to them, nobody would be drinking clean water. And that‚Äôs the sad truth. Use this to your advantage. This is great advice for my situation! only ship that doesn‚Äôt sail is a partnership Very interesting. Some guy with an English accent on YouTube who has started 18 companies or something and made a long video containing the cliff's notes of his wisdom advised specifically that you should seek out a business partner, because there will be things you hate doing, and you should find someone who complements you in that way. Maybe you're the face and the ideas and they're the books or whatever.

I can probably guess but do you mind to elaborate on why one should specifically not get a business partner? totally agree with True, I learned it a hard way. Got totally screwed. I had one business that was a partnership and that failed. The business is still active, we‚Äôre no longer partners. 

I have another business (nearly 7 years in) and that has a partner. I wouldn‚Äôt enjoy my business nearly as much if I didn‚Äôt have someone to share the workload and bounce ideas. My current strategy in writing. this here is it, cos once you start no going back only implementing This. 

I‚Äôd also let them know that the best way to network is to make friends with everyone. How did you start networking? I'm a high school student and I feel so awkward talking to others Hey there I have two business ideas and id want to hear someones opinion can I send you a message That is deep!! I love that answer!! Hey there I have two business ideas and id want to hear someones opinion can I send you a message True!! This is exactly true. You can make every move perfectly and your business can still fail for reasons outside of your control. Being an entrepreneur is not for everyone. Hey there I have two business ideas and id want to hear someones opinion can I send you a message It‚Äôs funny, because this goes against what everyone else says about just starting. Hey there I have two business ideas and id want to hear someones opinion can I send you a message Is it possible to get into the industry as a high school student? I want to get into luxury retail and get an idea of how everything works but I have no prior experience (since I'm a student) + worried that my age would turn some heads away. Should I just try to intern in another industry first? Hey there I have two business ideas and id want to hear someones opinion can I send you a message Yes lord!!! So true!! Or find someone who can validate it for you. A mentor in the industry who has already been there and knows its likelihood of success. That‚Äôs how we got into our business and it‚Äôs been three years in the making, but my husband can finally quit his day job to do this full time after 3 years of dedicated effort to build his business on the side. Along the same lines, avoid as much overhead as you can. Don‚Äôt jump the gun by renting a space before you even know if you can fill it, so to speak. Hey there I have two business ideas and id want to hear someones opinion can I send you a message I learnt this the hard way when I got permanently banned from a subreddit that has my exact target demographic. Never ask your customers for anything. Always give them something. no get a business partner a cofounder 1. decreases your workload and increases the amount you can do 2. also you cant know everything your cofounder may work in technical side of things while you do marketing but also businesses that have cofounders are more likely to succeed then those that dont. also you can easily get feedback. but again this depends on who you ask and what you are even doing. but i recommend it heard that on the dave ramsy show, but true have the üîó? >I‚Äôd also let them know that the best way to network is to make friends with everyone.

People always buy from and do business with people they like. Don‚Äôt ask another startup group member - ask someone (actually 10 people) that would be a prospective customers of each. It‚Äôs what they think that matters. I wrote a book about this and developed a framework called [Business as a Baby](https://linktr.ee/chumze). The book comes out on January 31st, feel free to check my bio for more details. I see this scenario all the time because it was my own experience. 

My first venture failed because I tried to manage a baby company like an adult. A business develops in stages, baby, toddler, teenager, and adult. In the baby stage, it‚Äôs all about survival. Sure thing! Send a message Absolutely I‚Äôm more of an ‚Äòtake inspired action‚Äô kind of entrepreneur, not a ‚Äòleap and the net will appear‚Äô type. You should be able to get a job at a luxury retail store or potentially intern within the industry. When looking for a job, age isn‚Äôt as much of a concern as personality and level of maturity Fill your boots. Congratulations!!! Sent Thanks for telling me, I definitely feel more confident! I'll try giving it a shot when I get the chance!! (Time to start learning how to use Linkedin lol)",2025-01-19 17:23:19

This sort of software is used by big enterprises, and I am sure there are teams out there looking for implementing this sort of features in their internal systems.

You can even get a free like month or something for them to use it.

I‚Äôve had success just asking ChatGPT to do this with tables in PDFs. Might want to check that out before going too deep down the rabbit hole. I built this for lenders and ancillary finance groups.

* **Next.js** on **Vercel**
* **Supabase**
* **Resend** (1k emails/month)
* **Figma**
* **Stripe** (fee-based)

It‚Äôs a real eye-opener that a couple nights of coding + free or nearly free tools can get you real users.

**What made the difference?**

* Talking about it in relevant communities (on Reddit, Twitter, etc.).
* Inviting beta testers early and offering them real value.
* Keeping the build and UX very minimal so I could ship fast.

There are a lot of businesses that re-release their apps multiple times, maybe even shift the focus from one idea to anoth",good,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i57ekr/too_hesitant_to_release_my_app/,Too hesitant to release my app,"A few months ago I was hit with a bolt of inspiration and had some extended downtime, so I developed an app. Its a health&fitness that fills a gap in my current suite of h&f apps. It's now \`finished\`, at least as an MVP candidate, but I'm hesitant about releasing it for a few reasons:

\- I'm much more comfortable wearing the engineering hat, rather than the designer hat, so I basically punted on any serious design work while developing. I hired a designer off Upwork, but she ended up being an expensive mistake (no communication, no collaboration), and her designs are not something I want to move forward with. Needless to say, the design of the app is unsatisfactory to my eye.

\- There's not really anything else like it on the market. I did a lot of extensive research on existing solutions and haven't found anything quite like my app. What this tells me is that, either no one really wants it, or it's been tried and failed (I did find three other somewhat similar apps - 1 was acquired a few years ago, one appears to be in a prolonged beta, and one more is fairly successful on the App Store, tho its only tangentially similar to mine (and much more full-featured)).

\- Because there's not quite anything like it in the market, I didn't really have anything to 'borrow' ideas from. For example, if it was just a workout app or a meal tracker, there's plenty of established examples and people already have a good idea of what to expect. Everything I've implemented is pretty novel which makes me question everything.

\- Unsure if the feature set could be called \`complete\`. Related to point above\^, without any existing apps to draw inspiration from, I had to develop everything from scratch. It works, and it answers the questions I initially sought to answer, but I'm not sure if its feature-heavy enough to justify any sales.

\- Rough edges - there's so many of them. I'm pretty self-critical when it comes to my work. There's a lot of things (mostly UI and UX) that aren't as polished as I'd like. I could keep buffing it, but it would seem to  be never ending. 

\- I'm uncomfortable with \`selling\`. Truth is, even tho I've been a software engineer for many, many, many years, none of the products I've worked on were ever 'sold' (they've all been freemium-type products). As a result, I don't really have a good calibration for product value. Honestly, I didn't start out intending to charge for this app, but I do think it's worth a small fee to use as it provides answers to questions that aren't currently easily accessible.

  
Any advice would be appreciated.

","Fortune favors the bold. Shipped is better than perfect. I'd release and keep interating on improving it. You must release it now. This was one of the biggest mistakes I made a few years back when I started building SaaS apps. I thought that I must have the most polished and perfect app when I release, one that can compete with big name brands, but that is not a good approach and it's actually impossible to do. This is because with any startup idea you must first validate it, release it and see how people like it and iterate from there.

And also don't think that if you release the app now that is the end of it. There are a lot of businesses that re-release their apps multiple times, maybe even shift the focus from one idea to another, till you find market fit.

As an example, my team and I released [https://manyseats.com/](https://manyseats.com/) a couple of days ago. This is a free scheduling platform that as of right now only has the basic features needed, sort of an MVP. We released it event tough we don't even have an subscription or other advanced features, because now we want to validate it, have people use it, see what they like, what they don't. And then grow upon that.

I also recommend the Y Combinator YouTube channel where you can find more info like this (including the fact that you should release your startup as soon as possible). 1. if you dont release it you wont get anything from it take it as a learning experience 2. you need to promote it online you are releasing it into a sea of apps 2. figure out who the app is for your demographic what marketing they like 3. meta ads? also you want to advertise the transformation or wut it does also potentially use a micro influencer ( or that one health guy on instagram that reviews food that is wut i think of first anyways) dont limit yourself till you have to and make sure you get user feedback have some way users can tell you what they do or dont like and maybe even before releasing it get feedback but always be updating to increase UI n UX otherwise people get bored! Release it. Don't think just do. You will learn more from releasing it than not showing it to the world. The more feedback you get, the more you make it better! You do not have to ""sell"" your app. You are solving a problem that can benefits many people!",2025-01-19 14:58:16

I bounced from loosing everything but the love of my life, to nearly paying everything off and starting expansion once again. Has anyone figured out how to get past this feeling? Even if just for a small amount of time","a powerful exercise is to sit quietly in a empty room with no one for 30 minutes. No noise, don‚Äôt speak, dont think don‚Äôt listen to nothing, just sit quietly and watch your thoughts. 
You will feel better, clearer and with a better sense of scope. Then write 5 things you are the best at, and 5 things you like to do in order of importance. Then connect one thing you are the best at with one thing you are most passionate at and figure out how to monetize this. 
Starting a business? Consulting? Courses?
Just do something.
Don‚Äôt stand in the noise, don‚Äôt figure out how to make money without knowing what I told you. work on yourself. You can have more than you‚Äôve got because you can become more than you are.
The market rewards value. You just have to become more valuable, and you will forget the time when you wasn‚Äôt able to pay the bills. You‚Äôll always feel like you‚Äôre not doing enough unless you set clear metrics for success and track them. It‚Äôs like hitting the gym every day but never measuring your progress‚Äîwithout the data, it always feels like you‚Äôre making no progress and need to do more. Dude I too suffer from it, this sense of inadequacy. Don't try to be cool, accept yourself as a normal person and spend time with those who accepts you and give you peace.¬†


Other than that live on the day to day basis atleast, without trying to plan constantly. Plan your next day and commit to that only. Plan your month at once and your future also once a month post that just stick to one day at a time and relish the moments.¬†


The modern world thrives by making us feel inadequate. Inadequacy of knowledge, money, power, work, friends, character, you name it. Do not fall for it.¬†


Watch out your self talk.¬† You‚Äôve got to be OK with not doing work. Force yourself to go outside. I have to work on it everyday, and I‚Äôve been working on it for almost 10 years.

It‚Äôs kind of like a blend of impostor syndrome, chasing the dragon, and sunken cost fallacy. You just have to step away.

Sometimes I‚Äôll tell myself that I‚Äôll only work on customer requests or support today. And if it‚Äôs quiet I can do whatever I want. As far as busyness is concerned ? Or wanting more, I definitely experience this but what has helped me is have a clear outline of the big picture and ‚Äúthe why‚Äù.

It‚Äôs not about the money‚Ä¶. There‚Äôs more to it. You just got to understand it and only you can. Assuming you might be American? But the goal in life isn‚Äôt to just keeping doing more and more, you win when you have the option to do nothing. Despite what everyone trying to brainwash everyone in the world. get help talk to a psychologist or any friend Sounds like you need to talk to a therapist, or start meditating. Not all business solutions can be found in business books. This is not necessarily a bad feeling. It‚Äôs an opportunity to look in the mirror & evaluate whether you‚Äôre REALLY working the right ways or just working. Be hardcore honest with yourself about HOW you‚Äôre working & what you‚Äôre spending your BEST energy on. 

Of course, without knowing your situation that is very topical & broad but focus on what specifically you‚Äôre failing at & shift your goals to done. Bask in the glory of done. Start working towards done in everything you do. Don‚Äôt let something get 85% on you & not close it out Pete. Sometimes you just have to encourage yourself and dig deep and make the decision to stay disciplined and keep on keeping on. Feelings are fickle and come and go but discipline and consistency are keys to staying focused. Instead of letting yourself get caught up in feeling inadequate, focus on what you are doing, how far you have come and where you want to go and strategize the steps you need to get there. This will help you redirect your energy and focus. And when no one else is around to encourage you, encourage yourself. I hear you‚ÄîI‚Äôve felt the same way at times. It‚Äôs tough when you‚Äôre constantly pushing for more, even after bouncing back from tough times. One thing that‚Äôs helped me is setting small, achievable goals and actually celebrating when I hit them. It‚Äôs easy to overlook how far you‚Äôve come when you‚Äôre always looking ahead.  

Also, try to give yourself credit for the fact that you \*are\* rebuilding and expanding‚Äîthat‚Äôs no small feat! Maybe take a step back for a moment and look at the bigger picture. What you‚Äôre feeling is normal for anyone striving for growth, but it‚Äôs also a sign you care deeply about what you‚Äôre doing.  

Hang in there‚Äîyou‚Äôre doing more than you think. üòä It's called imposter syndrome. And yes you can get past it by not judging yourself and comparing yourself. I write my goals in advance and say to myself that if I reach these goals I should be proud. I do it yearly but also weekly. Helps having something to go back to when the critical voices get going. The hell I just wanna know how the heck do you bounce back after technically losing everything right after you lost the love of your life and a parent on top of an insanely amount of other dominoes that have fallen in the last couple years?

Because I either used to have an amazing look and it‚Äôs turned or somebody in my past life has done something something unforgettable and this is their karma that I‚Äôm having to deal with or I‚Äôm not doing something right. But I‚Äôve done everything to come back up, but I think my main problem is I can‚Äôt get back out of my funk.

So honestly, I think the main question is how do you get out of any funk when you feel like you‚Äôve hit your rock bottom. 

I‚Äôve looked for answers and I‚Äôm now on the Internet asking for opinions. I literally have nothing else. no i feel the same way but i am also comparing myself to someone who has had privileges i have not. Journaling helps, talking about it helps just focus on you like you are doing enough and you need to think of everything you have done everything you have experienced and then think of where you are now after going through all that you are still trying again which is enough in itself most people would just lay there on the ground and accept defeat. Thank you for the suggestions. It‚Äôs not the making money that‚Äôs the problem, it‚Äôs the constant feeling that I am not doing enough. If I have a free moment there is always something I could be doing. It‚Äôs Sunday morning where I am and I already am planning my mandatory versus not necessary work details today, after working 22 hours over previous 2 days You should think about becoming a motivational speaker, cause damnnn that's some good stuff! Said well üôåüôå I took a screenshot of this and going to put this into practice. Great response, thank you! Focus on the vital few, rather than the trivial many.
You feel there is always something else to do because you don‚Äôt do what‚Äôs truly important.
There is nothing worst than to do well things that are not relevant. And if you do what‚Äôs not important, you will never have satisfaction or sense of achievement.

My other suggestion is:
Each night, make a list of the most important 3 things you absolutely need to achieve for the following day. 3 things, just 3 fundamental things that are absolutely necessary for your success. Do not do any other activity until those 3 objectives are not perfectly done. 
And after that, make a list of the things you want to do and use the A B C D strategy.

A - Focus on what‚Äôs most important and urgent. B - Tackle tasks that are important but not time- sensitive. 
C - Address urgent but less critical tasks. 
D - Delegate or discard tasks that aren‚Äôt urgent or important.

However, my priorities have since changed, and now I am leveraging multiple platforms by posting daily and generating decent revenue from it. With Google‚Äôs regular algorithm updates over the past few years and the evolution of search platforms after AI agents came into play, I noticed how the search landscape is shifting. Google now prioritizes YouTube Shorts, social channels, and AI overviews, and I believe most entrepreneurs are already aware of this trend.

As a result, last year, I started posting on various social channels, including Discord, Quora, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Facebook, Threads, Reddit and more. We now manage 20+ social accounts and focus on creating niche-specific leads for our audience in a cost-effective way. Since we are working on a global marketing platform that connects tech tools, marketers, and SEO engineers, it has been necessary to stay consistent and show results. Our efforts have resulted in up to 300k views per month across our social channels and a steady increase in website traffic.

We are keeping our pricing under $99 for 6 months, which includes promotional material like images and video shorts shared across 12+ social channels. We have already onboarded several tools onto our platform, generating good revenue since the end of last year.

As we attract niche-specific audiences, our response rate for DMs and emails has significantly improved. Our year-long effort has started to pay off, and our day-to-day learning is helping startups market their tech products effectively while saving time. This process is something we aim to continue for the long term while learning from our failures and consistently updating ourselves.

We are developing a new UI/UX tailored for an all-in-one global marketing platform, which will be introduced in the next version.","Have you considered doing an intro workshop of your company?

Thank you so much for taking the time to help!","Seems like everyone is doing digital marketing these days Try creating an AI Agent that will help you out in that because the Agent can do wonders for you. I have a offer for you,  look around in your locality or somewhere in google maps  and ask them if they need any help with their business (resturants, hotels, plumbers  etc ) and if building a software website or app can solve them and provide them with an Idea. Contact me if they need any of those things. You will get money for every business that agrees to build their software. The money may vary according to the project... I will handle the rest ...building software and enerything... You need to take risks. You could setup a cold sales outreach service business to get sales leads on behalf of other businesses. Freelance virtual assistant, graphic designer something like that. I have also heard that cleaning businesses are pretty low effort to start, you would essentially just need to purchase the products, hire some cleaning staff (freelance) advertise your services and manage the bookings. As others have said, you could do various digital marketing activities for businesses online like SEO or social media management, but it may take some time to build a presence, a brand and enough 'social capital' that people will buy your services over and above others and there will be some setup costs in all of these cases also. If you know how to make music you can sell beats, samples, stock music etc. There really are tons of things you could do. The fact that you have already got video editing skills is great, why don't you do that, there are so many content creators out there that could use your skills. If you already have advanced skills you can create courses for video editing and sell those on places like Udemy. Maybe make an account on Fiverr. You can freelance there & a few other similar platforms. Crypto airdrops Hi there! With your video editing experience, you could offer your skills to small businesses, content creators, or startups looking for engaging video content. Many brands need short-form videos for social media, so creating templates or packages for them could be a great niche. If you're open to learning, explore selling customizable video templates on platforms like Etsy. Starting small and focusing on quality can help you build something sustainable over time. Hope this helps! Are you good at managing people? Are you good at intimidating your competitors with your charm? Are you good at convinci people? If all of that checks out, how much money do you have that you can dedicate to your business? Business owner here, get these all the time, none of them are proving value i alredy have but its very compitative, not getting reguler work Providing value is most important. Having a software can smooth your work flow, like  booking systems etc,  business  can either do it manually or automatic using some softwares if the volume of data is large.  For offline business what's more important than a software is to provide quality service/materials. Software can only enhance that, but it does not change the product unless the software is the product itself. It is definitely saturated now. How about something on indeed? Maybe a remote position is available. 

I know you said an online business, but maybe something like Instacart could be of interest. They have driving positions, but also people that just shop in the stores. You can just pick up shifts when you want, which is nice.

Most of those professions are primary male-dominant professions like plumbers, electricians, wood workers and coffin makers etc. What professions like this and consequently business ideas could perform well where the workers/owner is a woman? I guess cleaning services, nanny services and stuff like that. 
I also think that electricians jobs can be easily performed by a woman, there's not much heavy lifting there. What else? 

Edit: I live in an Eastern European country  and I am concerned about sexist views impacting ability to run a business in traditionally male field. Also I'm not keen on heavy lifting most of the time, that's the only hard NO for me.","Cleaning companies. Crime scene cleaning. Biohazard. Affluent parents will overspend on their kids, and Women are more trusted than men to work on them, after school pickup and art or music or computer or math lessons tend to pay well (think Kumon ...) I know 3 women who each started a home cleaning business. Each one now has a crew and is no longer cleaning, only setting up clients and invoicing. It's still a ton of work to manage, but they make well into the 6 figures. Nursing. Marketing. There is huge cash in marketing even though it isn‚Äôt dirty it‚Äôs hard as hell. Electricians don't have to lift a lot, but they do have to climb into attics on hot days occasionally (moreso with HVAC, but electricians still do), also it takes at least 4 years to get a license to work on your own (might be 6) My plumber is a woman, as are my doctor, optometrist, dentist, lawyer, ¬†and accountant. The cop that gave me my last ticket was also female. Its 2025. Women can do *anything* that doesn‚Äôt require specific male organs or fluids.¬†You just need to get some skills.¬†

(I‚Äôm a male, if anyone is wondering). Franchise owners can be the boss of any of those industries. For example the owner of a roofing or painting franchise would never be expected to pick up a hammer or a paint brush. If you have management abilities and can follow a process then you can own a franchise in any industry you choose. OF Accounting Areas such as beauty and aesthetics consulting (marketing, coaching, or business), healthcare services (caregiving, physical therapy, home nursing), the food market (delivery ‚Äì haha, my field), food trucks, homemade products, and specialized cleaning (post-construction, offices). Have you ever made a quilt? It's super intense.  
Same for planning weddings or catering. I can't believe I have to say this in 2025 but women can do anything.

 **We'd love your input! Could you answer a few quick questions?**

1. What‚Äôs the biggest challenge you face when trying to learn entrepreneurship?
2. Have you ever struggled to find affordable, quality educational resources for starting a business?
3. How important is personalized mentorship for your learning experience?
4. What kind of features would make an entrepreneurship learning platform more valuable to you?
5. Do you find it difficult to connect with others who share your entrepreneurial interests?
6.  Do you feel represented in the entrepreneurship space? Court reporting. Also other specialized cleaning, there's a company in San Francisco that specializes in Chandeliers. Doggie pickup Thanks. I have no problem with atticks on hot days or  taking 4 years to learn something. Are there any other male jobs like this that won't include much heavy lifting? You live in America(probably) , I live in Eastern Europe. I am considering to become a plumber or electrican and you have no idea how much backlash from my family I've experienced. A lot of them has told me that nobody would employ me and people would deny being my customers solely because I'm a woman.
My question was asked because: it's sometimes very hard to walk against the stream. But empowering of women doesn't just mean to work jobs that are considered ""male"". Empowering also means using your strengths to open a business in a *favourable* field and earn  money and power as a woman  in a world where the reacherst people are men. From that position you are more likely to make changes. lol @ the ticket

I‚Äôve been cited for speeding (more than a few times) and generally found women to be less abrasive and more business like when writing me up. Right? What a frustrating question this is. ? I don‚Äôt think any quilters could get paid what they deserve unless they had very very strong marketing. Yes they can technically, but in practice it's a whole other story. First there are some professions that include lifting heavy stuff and I wouldn't do that and most women wouldn't. But if another woman decides to do that, I have 0 problems. 
Second, I live in eastern europe and was considering to become a plumber or electrician . Do you know the backlash i got primary from my family? How many people said they would never take a woman plumber? So, we still need feminism, and there are still professions that are not so favorable for women.  I can go against the stream, but it's very hard to fight it.And you know what Is also a feminist move? Having a business and earning money and power, in a world where mostly the rich people and business owners are male. From that position you can make more change Well I guess we live in different worlds. I don't say it's impossible to have a plumbing service as woman. But where I live in eastern europe it's  a field that literally has 0% women in it by the last statistics. If I become a plumber with a service, the customers won't trust me because I'm a woman and most of them won't call me again. I'll have a hard time finding  workers-plumbers because male plumbers wouldn't work for a woman. So yeah, maybe it's technically possible, but It's a mad idea, at least where I live. I mean being smaller might be an advantage too (can fit into tighter spaces). Heavy Machinery operators (Cranes, Bulldozers...), Dumpster Hauling Btw lawyers, doctors and dentists are actually predominantly female in my country. Just construction workers are mostly male, the statistics are that there is literally 0% of women in that field.

And  I guess I didn't define my question well. What are some basic services, blue-collar jobs that can turn into well profitable  businesses. Sounds like you should stop speeding. Lol tell that to my husband who was chewed out by a female cop on a power trip. Her argument didn't even make sense. ""I had to go 60 to catch you so you were doing 75"" type explanation. OF refers to onlyfans, which is more or less a porn website for self employed porn stars. This person is suggesting you become a self employed porn star. Lol right wtf is this. No handmade textile art is ever going to sell for an appropriate amount considering the number of hours that went into it I think you should update your post to reflect that you are in Eastern Europe and are concerned about sexist views impacting ability to run a business in traditionally male field. Updating your post will help avoid ¬†‚Äúwomen can do anything‚Äù comments. I would say that any blue collar business can be run by a female. My female plumber makes an *absolute* killing as she markets herself as a female plumber and uses her gender to distinguish herself and her company, which has many plumbers under her, and set her in contrast to the traditional male run plumbing companies.¬†

However, if you are dealing with sexism and discrimination from a culture that has clearly defined gender expectations, things will be tougher. You can either try to be a trail blazer and start a business outside of traditional gender norms or you can, which may fail or cause personal problems as a result of you trying to operate outside of gender expectations, or you could focus on starting a gender appropriate business.¬†

Not sure what country in Eastern Europe, but I suspect that if you live in a region where women cannot due ‚Äúmens‚Äô work‚Äù you may also run into sexism issues even if you start a gender appropriate business as women‚Äôs labour may be viewed as less valuable. This may impact what you can charge.

However, in North American, cleaning businesses can become extremely successful even when female operated. Just do good work, have a consistent stream of clients, and get a few cleaners working for you. I don‚Äôt think there is much money in nanny work I‚Äôve been driving 30-50k miles a year on highways for about 25 years. 

You‚Äôll understand when you get a bit older how things just pile up Ha! Yeah perhaps it was just my luck that the couple I‚Äôve dealt with were competent. Good idea, I will :) Well your reasoning is pretty good. But for some reason this is mostly for blue-collar construction related and heavy lifting jobs, otherwise many women have businesses and it is not so frowned upon. Ofc if in the mean time you manage to have husband and 2 kids.
Anyways, maybe you are right. Maybe I'm just too afraid to make that move and be the woman plumber/electrician. Probably most women would be happy to hire me and my family will calm once they see the income. I mean, I'm 42 and have had like 3 speeding tickets... At what age do they pile up? I'd like to think most are. They have a chip on their shoulder working in a male dominated field and probably feel extra pressure to prove themselves. I feel like a lot of female clients (single women, stay at home moms, etc) would prefer to hire a female plumber or electrician out of safety concerns. I think the fact that you‚Äôre unlike most trades workers in your country would make you a really solid brand and appeal to a strong niche of customers. Good luck OP! Sounds like it‚Äôs already started.

Considering our circumstances are completely different your mileage may vary.",2025-01-18 20:53:13

The trip has been great. We stayed at camps in three national parks. Yeah i cant compete with hotels and other partners who works on tourism they may capitalise this. I have to go lowkey Im glad you","good, great, easy",,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i4jc2m/how_i_turned_a_simple_idea_into_a_small_business/,How i turned a simple idea into a small business in my touristic town,"I‚Äôm a 29 yearold from Arusha, Tanzania. A year ago, I was working as a barista in a hostel frequented by tourists heading out on safari. It was a decent job, but like many people in my community, I was barely getting by.

While working at the hostel, I noticed something interesting many women tourists casually mentioned wanting to braid their hair before heading into the national parks but didnt want to spend hours finding and sitting in a local salon

Around that time, I often passed by two women braiding hair on the street near my neighborhood. They were incredibly skilled That‚Äôs when the idea hit me, why not bring their skills directly to tourists in a proffesional and convenient way

I bought some tools and I approached the women with a proposal. They‚Äôd do the braiding, I‚Äôd handle finding clients, coordinating appointments, and ensuring everything went smoothly. I offered four styles: box braids, cornrows, boho braids, and halo braids, with prices ranging from $35 to $80 depending on the style.

I started small. I asked tourists at the hostel if they‚Äôd like their hair braided right there, without the hassle of going to a salon. To my surprise, many of them said yes. They loved the idea of getting a cultural hairstyle as part of their Tanzanian experience. Word spread quickly, and soon I was getting referrals

Now, with no advertising, just word of mouth and collaborations with two hostels, I‚Äôm serving more than 10 clients a month. The women I work with are thrilled they‚Äôre earning more money than they ever thought possible. One of them even mentioned being able to afford school fees for her daughter for the first time in years.

I know this idea has so much more potential. Every month, thousands of tourists pass through Arusha on their way to safari. This service could scale significantly with the right resources better branding, partnerships with more hotels and lodges, and perhaps even an app or online booking system.

Right now, I‚Äôm focusing everything, reinvesting what little I make to keep things going. I don‚Äôt have the capital to take this to the next level, but the demand is clear. Tourists love the convenience, the cultural experience, and the quality of the braiding, and the women here love the opportunity to earn a good income.

This journey has taught me that great ideas don‚Äôt have to come from big budgets they can come from simply looking around and seeing what people need. I‚Äôm excited about what‚Äôs ahead, and I‚Äôm determined to grow this idea into something that creates real impact.

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts especially if you‚Äôve faced similar challenges or have advice for someone trying to scale a small but meaningful business.
","congrats.

people often think you need big budgets to start or grow.  for booking multiple if the website builders will have an appointment app built in. you could get into them for $10 USD a month. 

when you don't have a huge budget focus on service level those changes can be done for free.   Register on Google business, Instagram, Facebook and upload photos. You want to be seen as legitimate and not a scam.  When all else fails raise prices a bit. great post and great little business you've started. 

have you started reaching out to other most popular hostels/hotels? sounds like you have an easy opportunity to expand. you said you worked at the first hostel... how did you collab with the second? This is entrepreneurship. You are benefiting everyone. Yourself, the hair stylists, and the tourists. It's a win win. I would say to take it at a pace that makes sense for you. Scaling services can be tricky because scaling quality isn't easy. I would make sure you learn the ins and outs of what your customers love and how you can make things better. No need to rush and do everything at once. Your success will soon be noticed by others, who will start undercutting (no pun intended) you. You now need a strategy to combat this. This is awesome and good for you ! 

I was just there hiking Kilimanjaro. For all the girls, having your hair braided would be a huge help for the trip. Why not reach out to the tour guides too and see if they offer it. 

The way I would do it - research how long you can have the braids, how it helps with keeping the hair clean, keeping it out of the way etc. and come up with a nice 1 pager , marketing flyer. And go hand deliver it to the tour guide hotels 

Good luck ! Beautiful country ! Thats awesome, congratulations man This is such an awesome story! You took a simple observation and turned it into something that helps both tourists and your community‚Äîthat‚Äôs incredible. The fact that you‚Äôre giving these women a steady income and even helping with things like school fees is so inspiring.

I totally see how this could grow. Maybe partnering with more lodges or hostels could bring in even more clients. Even something like a simple Instagram page to show off the braiding styles and happy tourists might help spread the word faster. And if an app feels too expensive right now, maybe just using WhatsApp or a basic website for bookings could work?

You‚Äôve already done something amazing with limited resources, so I can only imagine what you could do with more support. Keep going‚Äîyou‚Äôre onto something really special here! Good on ya.  
You seen the opportunity and jumped on it.  
Congratulations How about taxes and bureaucracy? Good on you, no offense intended. I‚Äôm in Tanzania, on the tail end of a two week safari. My wife would have been interested in this, and any skin-hair care products that would be valuable for a safari.

Network like crazy with the guides and tour companies so they make their clients aware of what you do. You may have to pay a commission to them.

We were in Arusha for two days preparing for the safari. That‚Äôs an awesome example of spotting a simple need and turning it into a business that actually helps people on both sides: tourists get a convenient, culturally immersive service, and the local stylists earn more doing what they‚Äôre great at. It‚Äôs cool how you leveraged existing foot traffic at the hostel, plus word-of-mouth to grow organically. This definitely shows that you don‚Äôt need a huge budget or fancy tech to start‚Äîjust a real problem/need and a creative way to solve it.

If you can keep building partnerships with more hostels, maybe build a simple booking system (even just a WhatsApp business number at first), you might grow this into a larger-scale service without breaking the bank. Kudos for empowering local artisans in the process‚Äîstories like these remind me that entrepreneurship can be win-win for everyone involved. Keep it up and best of luck! This is wonderful to read, congrats. My thoughts: rather than scale your services, pivot and become the booker for the braiders who do the actual work. Operate as the owner of a salon does - you manage bookings from a free site or form, interview and train your braiders, and take a percentage of the booking. If people want to hire you directly, then they pay a premium. If people want to work directly with the braiders, take a referral fee for the next x appointments, etc. Fucking great!! Congratulations!! Yes! U definitely need an app to spread the word of mouth to more areas. I would love to help creating a landing page of the app for you for free and send you a screenshot of it so that you can give me feedback if its okay or not. Let me know if you are interested. You‚Äôre well on your way. You need a website and socials. Create a brand. Also look into affiliate marketing for your service as well. Think bigger, you are the real cultural ambassador. Sell local crafts to them. Refer to them local restaurants and ask restaurants to pay for advertisement. This is sick congrats man, making use of every opportunity around you Why didn't you try ecommerce? Well done!! Congrats ü•≥ goes to show you already have all you need to establish a good business Nice! Congratulations sir. You've found a great niche. Next I'd focus on partnering with hotels and people management. Once people see this great business, you will soon have competitors and it will be up to you to offer the best organised service and compete. Think about what the hotel gets in return for working with you. Are you the safest, the best organised, do you share a comision with the hotel? Good luck! We are rooting for you to continue in your success. Thank you Because there is a great ecosystem between guides,tour companies and hotels.

Learning is taking a lot of my energy, let alone actually building/doing something. I think I am stuck in a very funny situation. I haven't done anything for a long time, just learning and wasting my time watching movies to freshen up my mind.","You will never be skilled enough. So just start. You‚Äôll fuck up and it‚Äôs part of the process, just take a step in any direction and it will be progress. Do you have an idea of what you want to do? You're not learning, you're procrastinating. A very big difference. Learning is when you apply the knowledge. You should publish your shit within 3 weeks from the initial idea until publishing date, and let the market refuse or accept it. Let your fear get exposed and die. That's the only way you'll learn, or understand it's not for you and change career path. Try to just start and learn through failure. If you want to learn quickly, this is the best way.

The other two options are:

1. Get a mentor who reached a point  in their business that you want to reach one day, and learn from them.

2. Read a ridiculous amount of marketing books, and take notes. Aside from maybe negotiating, marketing is probably the most valuable skill any entrepreneur could learn. At some point you have to start questioning whether you're still really learning, or just procrastinating. Introspection is hard, but it's a key life skill. My question is why do you want to start your own business?
Is it just because you want to make a ton of money?
Or are you passionate about creating something? Or any other reason if you have got any. You are procrastinating. Stop procrastinating and get started. No one knows everything nor will they ever. Find out what you want to do and do it. At some point you just have to jump in. You can study and learn all of the things but you won‚Äôt fully understand how to apply what you‚Äôve learned until you‚Äôre actually doing it first hand. It‚Äôs good to be prepared but now go apply it üíñ Start that business. You will never be 'skilled enough'... you can't learn it all, some lessons you will much better learn by doing the work Making mistakes is part of the learning process.
Not outsourcing or delegating tasks is a common mistake.
Not putting your plans into action and procrastinating is one of the worst mistakes you could make. Cool Find your users. Talk to them. Just Do! Give yourself a deadline, Deadline is the first productive force Start a project and reality will course correct you. Also, consider finding a co-founder who will complement you. Just start it Pick a horse and go! Have you thought of any product or a service? Who is your ideal client? Make them an irresistible offer. Try it out! Take your time no rush! I am literally almost across the finish line to launching my business.  And ive been at it for 2byrs. Because I am on welfare and I had to do what I could when I could. But it starts with your thinking and your belief in yourself.   And I learned everything watching youtube videos totally get this ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs easy to fall into the ‚Äúlearning loop‚Äù and feel like you‚Äôre never ready. but sometimes the best learning comes from just starting small. pick a micro-project, something you can build or test in a week. it won‚Äôt be perfect, but it‚Äôll give you momentum.

Even though I don't have a product or a service, I feel that you are overthinking about what it takes and you are off the track, you need to start your business first and then you will automatically improve your skills as you move along. 
There are no professional skills you can learn without actually doing the job. So just start, best of luck to you and may God bless you with a lot of prosperity soon. SaaS means Software as a Service; it's basically an app hosted online to allows users to access it. Thank you.",2025-01-18 13:21:52

You can also send that to chat gpt with your idea and ask it if you missed anything. Just start one foot in any direction is in the right direction This will be vague because you were vague.

Before you swipe a card on anything set up your business plan. A vision statement is even a good step 1 to really ground what you want to be. Figure out potential markets, revenue, general expenses. 

Figure out potential startup costs, if any, to have a go to market strategy. Whether seeking family financial help, bank loans or outside investors they will want to know exacts on this and what it looks like to be paid back.

Once everything has been put on paper and out of your head you should be able to assess if it is a tangible idea. Will it make money? If yes- how much? Figure out margins and costs on everything. Will it not make money? This is okay, non-profits exist and you can approach your entity filing differently and also your investor pool will be different.

Once you have a general business plan you think is a good idea after working through all these steps create your entity. Each state is different but it‚Äôs fairly simple to create a corporation or llc with the likes of legal zoom these days. This generates an EIN and separates most of your personal liability from the business.

Now that you have your business incepted you can open a new business bank account used for the business purposes and this only. It helps with accounting and financing in the future. Also reduces way too many headaches to list.

All of this can be done inside of a month or even a few weeks. 

Now your business is live and you can either seek funding, if necessary, or start marketing outreach for your potential client base. (This is assuming you already have the product or service ready for go-to-market. Obviously take time to generate the service/product before selling a paper idea). This is great advice. Thanks! This is so helpful, thank you. Of course :) everything is figuroutable, just start stepping and you‚Äôll find the way - and it‚Äôll probably be wrong and not perfect the first few times but it‚Äôs all part of the ‚ú®process‚ú® Also a good first step before everything would be doing a SWOT analysis of your company. This will help with marketing research and holes you need to focus on.",2025-01-18 12:59:24

1) Number one solution for me is sport, exactly - running.

For instant, few years ago I had one goverment contract where I lost 15 k, and in such situation I just go outside and running. The main idea is to find something what can swith your mind from a problem.

Also martial arts or ski are good for that, because while you are doing such activities, you are not allowed to think about somethin else. You have to be in a present moment, otheewise you ll get a hit directly to your nose.

2) Another option is to change enviroment. It could be a short trip somewhere.

3) Also I am trying to imagine the worst solution of situation and answer for myself is it dangeorus for me. So I kind of became used to the most dangerous scenario.  For example I had a period of my life when my company was on the brink of bankruptcy. And I just imagined the most worst scenario if had to close company and finding a job. And I got this situation and it helped me to avoid unnecesary concerns. Finding clients. Was/Still/Almost-out-of stuck in a spot without being able to move forward, due to production constraints of a product. 

Massively desperate to get out, so we've spent the last year on R&D to make the product more valuable. Have literally 23x'd the value in one year. 2025 is the year we break out. :)

I‚Äôve been trying to answer this question since I was a kid (and I‚Äôm serious when I say that), back when I didn‚Äôt even know what the word ‚Äúfounder‚Äù meant, and becoming one wasn‚Äôt even part of my plans.

As a kid, I played soccer, and like every boy my age, I watched all the stars on TV, got hyped, and told myself one day I‚Äôd be one of them. There‚Äôd be fans cheering for me, I‚Äôd score hundreds of goals, and all that bullshit. I was daydreaming.

The reality is I had to sacrifice a lot. I‚Äôd wake up at 6:00 AM, take the bus, and be at school by 8:00 AM. After classes, I‚Äôd finish at 1:00 PM, have lunch until 2:00 PM (always bringing a lunch box with me), and then wander around the city until 5:00 PM (sun, rain, snow, it didn‚Äôt matter). Then I‚Äôd train from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM, catch the bus home by 9:00 PM, and I was so tired I barely had the energy to eat dinner.

That was my life, day after day. And I promise you, for a 13/14 year old kid to keep up with that lifestyle, it takes more mental strength than physical strength. Then, after some things didn‚Äôt go as I planned, I realized maybe that wasn‚Äôt my path. It felt like when a girl breaks your heart (sounds weird, but for me, it was really like losing a love). But I also realized that soccer was pulling me away from so many other things. Once I quit, I got into skateboarding, computers, built a group of friends, traveled, and did so many things I hadn‚Äôt experienced before. That‚Äôs when I realized I had given up a lot for my dream, maybe without even noticing.

So, if you‚Äôve read this far, you‚Äôre probably wondering, *‚ÄúYeah, but what does this have to do with this subreddit, and what the hell is the ‚Äòfounder glitch‚Äô?‚Äù* Let me explain. Between the end of 2023 and the start of 2024, I was already coding, but I hadn‚Äôt built anything serious, at least no personal project that kept me glued to the PC for more than a week. But with a thousand ideas in my head, one random day I thought, why not make some of them real? That‚Äôs how I started building my first SaaS projects, **Describify** and **postonreddit**. Long story short, it was way harder than I expected. It took much more time, and I had both illusions and disappointments, as I mentioned in one of my recent posts. But that‚Äôs not the point. I was used to sacrifice, and it didn‚Äôt scare me.

I‚Äôm proud of what I‚Äôve built, the journey I‚Äôve taken to bring my ideas to life, and everything I‚Äôve learned and will continue learning through this whole process. The problem is, I think I‚Äôve fallen back into the same loop I had when I played soccer. What I call the ‚Äúfounder glitch,‚Äù which basically means sacrificing things to achieve your goal or dream.

Just like back then, I‚Äôm giving up a lot to make my ideas happen. Even right now as I‚Äôm writing this, I‚Äôm giving things up. And to be clear, I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs wrong, it‚Äôs a choice I‚Äôm making knowingly. But here‚Äôs my doubt: *is there a way to find balance and break out of this state?* I still don‚Äôt know how to answer that. I live every day like a roller coaster. But if you, reading this, don‚Äôt think everything I wrote is complete bullshit, let me know if you‚Äôve found a way to beat this problem.","I know this is just a marketing post, but the definition doesn't really make sense.  Glitch implies something sudden and temporary.  

I imagine dropping a picture into chatgpt and asking for a description could yield similar results, so why would I use describify?  How does it make my life easier?

Postonreddit kind of bothers me - I feel like we're on a path where we fill up every subreddit with posts like this one, where on the surface it's earnest discussion, but in actuality it's just marketing content trying to drive engagement.

Anyway, best of luck to you.  Consider a free tier to get some usage. Sure, just be born rich, take over daddy's business and hire people to do the actual work. Then every time will be T time. hello. i'm not english but i tried my best to understand you thought. If i'm right, your afraid of missing some events in your life cause your focus on a project ?

if it's that, i think that when you start a project, you go 1000% on it so you put your life on the side, why didn t slow the process, take your time and try to applicate your project in your life and not stop your life for the project. 

It was the same when you played footall. you lived for this, all you day turned around that. And it's perhaps the problem. you stop all to focus on one thing and it's normal, you want to do the things right. However, try to implement your projects at your life and don't live around your projects.

I hope that will help you, have a good day I simply named the projects I work on, because it is around those that my reasoning extends. 

For Describify, you won't get the same result with chat gpt, because mine is an AI model that exploits a set of information that I created manually, and it returns a human result. BTW I am also implementing the possibility of creating an ad and making it available on multiple sales platforms simultaneously, so as to increase sales changes.

To postonreddit, it is not necessarily a product to use reddit as a marketing platform. If you post a piece of content online you want it to be seen by as many people as possible (if not, why post it?) so I offer you a tool, which gives you that possibility, that's all.

For the free trial, I'm thinking about it, on postonreddit, as soon as it's launched anyway there will be freebies initially. Damn, i miss the first point ‚Äúborn rich,‚Äù so am i screwed?

Charmed his way from promoter to host, to doing own events to selling his guest list app now (globally) to other clubs. Hi, 

It's been now two week that i thinked about create a social network for companies. I know this seems crazy but i will explain and toothpast but in chewing gum

So all know Linkedn, but this app is focus on relation between employee and companies. So i want to create a plateform where companies can present themselves with description, photos. 

You know think that is dumb but let me finish. 

All companies will be sort by theme (electronics, travel...), localisation, size and others filters. The goal, is that comapnies can be see in a fyp ( for you page, like insta) to make themselves more know. Thus, if your are a companie that search, specfific services, you can search an other companies on this. 

My second idea, more reasonnable, is too have thootpast in the form of chewing gum, finish the time loose in the morning, can ""brush your teeth"" in your car, work, everywhere.

  
I hope is this enough crazy for you. AI music for niches is probably what I would do right now.¬†


Suno can make some wild music but it will be a long time until the masses on Facebook figure that out. Make it a luxury service. Some already are for love songs, you could do birthday songs for kids or something kind of like a personalized eCard. I believe the songs go for about $200 and the subscription with rights is $20/month right now. You could likely even charge more. Not sure how the parking lot situation is in Dubai but where I live it‚Äôs a great idea to buy a piece of land and make a parking lot What‚Äôs the app? Hi, for your second idea it might be a bit hard to profit from it as normal chewing gum would serve the purpose of 'replacing toothpaste'ü©µ  Maybe you can try a car/truck toothbrush for people always on the road. One idea that's even worse than this or better: Custom Christmas music.


Haha.¬†


Or a different niche that won't make your ears bleed so much.¬†


Still custom music made by AI is a big opportunity. yeah i see, i see, im new in entrepreneurship, i didnt think about the force of presence about toothpast. So it's not a good idea to want to replace a product as strong as thoothpaste ? You're on the right track solving daily problems. Replacing toothpaste is tough since it's so established, but you could focus on complementary products instead. For example, travel-friendly chewable tablets or disposable toothbrushes with built-in toothpaste for busy people. The key is finding a niche and solving a unique problem",2025-01-18 07:37:47

My two friends and I are thinking about starting a startup, but before we dive in blindly, we decided to research and validate the idea to see if it is feasible or not. So, I thought this would be a great place to ask questions about our ideas and get your thoughts.

The idea my mates and I came up with is to build a website where professionals can list themselves for consultancy services. For example, if you need legal advice from a lawyer for a small issue and don't want to go anywhere, you can book an appointment with the lawyer for just one hour, paying only for that hour. This would apply to all professionals in various categories, such as Health and Wellness, Legal and Financial, Education and Careers, Technology, etc.

My question is: how do I start validating this idea, and how should I go about researching market fit? I‚Äôve been assigned the role of researcher and validator, and I have only 20 days to gather as much information as possible so we can begin executing ASAP.

Thank you very much for your time. I am new at this journey so forgive me if i said something weird and unnecessary.

","Check out the competition, how well are they doing, is there a lot out there, who are the top competitors, what are they missing that will make you better/stand out To understand your market, you should do some research about your competitors and their customers/clients. I am sure there are several websites/apps/marketplaces like your startup idea. For validating ideas, here're 4 best ways to me:  
\- **Check if competitors exit or not and the size of your competitor** (a way to estimate market size). You can google or go to review sites such as Trustpilot, G2, ... or Directories such as Product Hunt, ...  
\- **Talk to users**: Define your ICP --> find where they often hang out (Subreddit, groups, communities, discord server, ...) --> Join the conversation, create value by comments, post, ... and make connection with them  
\- **Use keyword research tools to check the search volume of the specific keywords**. It reveals how many people are actually searching for it on the search engine.  
\- **Pre-sales**: you already have ideas. So if possible, build landing page in 1-2 days and create a **waitlist**. You can post on social media, use Ads, ... to promote it.

In addition, I built a tool to help you do this fast. If possible, you can check it out here ([1bnsolomate](https://1bnsolomate.com/)), would love to hear your thought. Thank you, I defientely will and can you suggest me some ideas where can i talk to users, ik this is studpiest question, I am new at this journey and idk how to do it. Thank you i will and i am also finding my competiors Thank this is something i need and we start finding our ideal coustomer. Thank you for your response Maybe check out competitors reviews, see what feedback they got so you can apply it to your company. Reddit is a good place too, find the subreddit where your users will hang out and start engaging with them. Good luck you got this !

I've studied their spending habits, they're all not that ba",,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i45res/why_do_talented_people_struggle_while_others/,Why do talented people struggle while others thrive ? ,"
I‚Äôve noticed that some highly intelligent and talented people, who learn quickly and work hard, often struggle financially or barely make ends meet. Meanwhile, others with fewer skills or less intelligence seem to become successful entrepreneurs and have doors open for them with ease. How much of this is influenced by the surrounding environment, social conditions, or the economic system of a country? Are there hidden factors at play? I‚Äôd love to hear your perspectives and experiences.","Talented and smarter folks tend to overthink and over engineer things.  
Entrepreneurship demands more scrappiness and 'Just do it' attitude. Confidence and conviction will win in sales and marketing all day over intelligence, and usually sales and marketing are the main difference between an idea and a thriving business.

Think about best selling books, many of them arent made by incredibly talented writers, some are just made by talented marketers and sellers.  Some of the best written books in the world will never be read because the writer doesn't know how to market or sell.  Some lucky counterparts get a good publisher to do that for them, but even selling yourself to the publisher takes a certain skill in selling. 

Opportunities and Ideas are almost unlimited, turning those into action/products and selling are how they become successful. 

Generally I would say (very guilty of this in the past) intelligent people spend too much time trying to improve the idea or remove the risk etc. 

Confident people launch and fail 100 ideas while we are still analyzing or building our first, and eventually, one of them hits because you learn when you do and you learn when you fail. When you do, take action, fail or not, you learn something about the market and about your customers. When you are still at the drawing board, you learn far less important things, potentially from people who wouldn't even be real customer etc. My first business was as in in-home computer tutor and troubleshooter here on Oahu. Another man I met had started at the same time as I did. Back then he was better than me with computers. 

However, even back then, I had spent a long time in sales. My business begin picking up faster than the other guy's because I knew how to sell myself.

Success is not just about talent it's about who you know and how well you can sell yourself. Another factor is conscientiousness, which is strongly tied to intelligence. This is a problem: the more intelligence, the more ethics/morals, the less likely to take shortcuts and deceive people (read: marketing) in order to make a quick buck. Not trying to be offensive but over the years I have learned you have to actually be just enough dumb and naive enough to be successful in building a company. 

Because no matter your idea you‚Äôll have a million people sayings it‚Äôs dumb, it won‚Äôt work, why bother, etc. You need confidence and naivety more than smarts. You hire the smart people to be your employees that‚Äôs why even the ‚Äúsmart founders‚Äù from Stanford and MIT you‚Äôll often find they took someone‚Äôs idea and made it better or even just needed that ‚Äúdumb‚Äù business person that pushed the business through. Those traits make you horrible at impulsive decisions, which sometimes is the key to making quick money lol Starting a business is extremely risky and intelligent people tend to overthink, and put a lot of weight into the potential negative outcomes. 

Dumb people just go with it, and sometimes get lucky and strike gold. 

Look at the ""My Pillow"" guy for example. It's highly unlikely that anyone intelligent would think that they could take over the pillow market. It's a ridiculous idea. Ex electrical engineer here. Being smart doesn't mean we're smart. One more thing to consider is that many intelligent people don‚Äôt value money and/or status to the same extent as most others Many of those people that would be considered ‚Äúless intelligent‚Äù have great personalities & connect well with people. I worked for a staffing company & we hired for skills but personality was at the top of the list, too. Nobody wants to work with an asshole 10+ hours a day, ya know?!? lol People skills are important. Building professional relationships, building and motivating a team. It‚Äôs a different type of intelligence that a lot of successful entrepreneurs seem to have. 

Highly intelligent people are able to get pretty far on their own so they never need to learn to work with or depend on others but there is a limit to what you can achieve on your own. There's a couple misconceptions.

Some believe significant up front work equates to wasted time.  On the contrary, this is the single best place to invest time because it is the cheapest value adding work you will ever get.  It is ALWAYS more costly, often significantly more costly to try and back fill with later or move forward with ignorance first and learn through costly failures and inefficiency on the back end. While fail fast, fail often is a very real and good thing, this is failure on the very front end where of costs you almost nothing.

An inexperienced or willfully incompetent person can and often does waste time because the work is their first time.  It is their learning, and they will make and repeat mistakes.  Inexperience equals slow.  Wilful ignorance equals incompetence.  Inexperience is inevitable unless you're willing to pay a premium for experience.  Otherwise the projects are the guys on the job training, slow, mistake prone, and all.

What actually wastes time?

Scope creep, mostly, but also high ambiguity of the project, goals, deliverables, etc.

You want high clarity, high definition, and a structured and fixed plan. You want the who project to be finite and thoroughly defined.  Not doing that wastes time.

Additionally, leadership steers the ship and is responsible for the work flow.  Poor leadership can often waste significant time down wrong paths, jumping back and fourth between projects/tasks, micromanaging, under utilizing talent, and often just plain communicating poorly. A lot of it is luck. 
Just chance of being having the right idea at the right time. Two most indicative factors are grit and socio-economic upbringing (zip-code) I know someone who‚Äôs dumb asf making Multiple six figures. He‚Äôs annoying but does the same thing everyday and is consistent. Remember the old saying that ignorance is bliss?

Sometimes it's best not to overthink things and just stumble dumbly forward. I think business is much more about grit than intelligence Paralysis of analysis becomes an issue. On every aspect of life. EVERY! Slows them then or sometimes don‚Äôt take any decision at all. A lot of smart people do a pretty quick risk reward and calculate it‚Äôs not worth it. And they are used to not failing. Not being wrong. Not being embarrassed.

Lots of entrepreneurs just don‚Äôt fear rejection, failure, embarrassment nearly as much. The less intelligent are able to connect to the masses who are just like them. This means they can dine with the classes by appealing to the masses. The more intelligence you have, the less you're able to connect to the brainwashed masses, and the less they can connect to you. Sometimes overly talented folks are too risk adverse to make things happen. Grit. Some weren't used to failing and didn't develop the mental fortitude to continue on. I think you might be underestimating some of the successful people who are ""less intelligent"", but as with everything there's a lot of factors in play some people have poor job prospects, no where to go if they fail, when that's the case can you imagine the drive from this person. Some people are less willing to engage in activities purely for how much money it's going to make them. Others will engage in any activity so long as it makes them the most money. This could be part of the reason ‚ÄúTalent‚Äù is relative to the exercise being assessed.

I‚Äôm a talented guitar player, but I cannot play saxophone.  You measure me as a guitar player = talent.  Measure me as a saxophone player = no talent.  

So while ‚Äútalented people‚Äù you refer to may have certain talents, what you miss is that they lack specific talents that are holding them back. Talent ‚â† Results  
Doers get more done. I think there's a fundamental misstatement in this post: The struggle implied here is financial. I suspect a lot of financially successful people struggle with things as well.

Now, in the context of financial success, there's no clear correlation between making money and talent (whatever **that** means) or intelligence. The smartest people in our society become scientists and musicians and we all know how much those people make on average...society does not normally reward creativity or intelligence. I'm setting aside musical stars or the like, who are wild outliers and whose success does not necessary correlate to talent of any kind.

The people we see making the most money are the ones who get lucky, are in the right place at the right time, and who typically have a...flexible attitude to the truth and to ethics. 

Financially, society often rewards people who have some sociopathic tendencies, which makes them willing to do things many of us wouldn't. Look at how bezos treats his workers. Look at how trump treats his people. Look at how musk treats everyone.

It also, as a more useful side note, rewards people who network and have extremely strong social connections. If you look at people who rise to the top of corporate ranks, a lot of their skills involve getting people to work with them. I had a startup CEO who got the CEO of a multibillion dollar networking company to kick off a multimillion dollar deal as a result of a bathroom meeting. I wasn‚Äôt ever that smart. Above average but in a school setting not so. My net worth just crossed 10M and it‚Äôs growing rapidly and I just turned 30. I have a few businesses. At the age of 18 i developed severe anxiety 
, depression which led to schizophrenia. I didn‚Äôt best it until the age of 24. Poor immigrant family origin. 

I‚Äôve always had the ability to adapt and get along with every race and every shades of society. So I never fear death, a jail cell or being broke. I have the attractiveness and charm to piece it all together. I can relate, because I‚Äôve done nothing but failed failed and failed. You have to be relatable. I tend to see that most highly intelligent people aren‚Äôt, they‚Äôre awkward and don‚Äôt understand social contexts. They tend to not understand the complexity of humans emotions, greed, lust, happiness and motivators. This is why they‚Äôre meant to be a hammer. To execute, designed to do a task perfectly but nothing more. I like to think entrepreneurs as jack of all trades and a master of none. Like a 16 in 1 Swiss Army knife! Because the others play the game of being licked Sales-like people thrive. E.G the ones with confidence and balls to take gambles, usually also have a lot of common sense (business sense).  

Creatives, talent, etc tend to be quieter and reserved.

You could argue that the sales people (CEO‚Äôs are glorified sales people) are dumber and have less talent but I disagree. 

It takes incredible talent to control conversations and make strategic business decisions. 

It‚Äôs just different talent. 

I admire creative talent though. True skill in an art, for example. And I feel bad that they often don‚Äôt get to the top or get taken advantage of unless they go freelance and successful with that. In order to get rich and successful you have to get cutthroat and thats where many people will choose morality over money. Life is cumulative of a series of small decisions you make over time. With every decision there is risk and reward. High risk and high reward. E.g. you run a company and some employee comes to you with an issue, maybe there is a vulnerability if not fixed with a major rearchitecture  could lose customer data or something but it will cost a lot to fix. One person could choose to fix it and lose money/time/traction while other will risk it and gain more money. Because talent doesn't make everything. Discipline is the key. I think by networking, you increase your luck. I mean, really deep networking. Not going to events and spraying you cards, but being long term friends with rich people. Nothing else matters that much.

World has hundreds of millions of hardworking people. Being hard worker or talented doesn't make you successful entrepreneur. Main issue here is whether you solve a rich person problem or not. My hot take. Being highly skilled or intelligent doesn't always mean you have the business, emotional, or strategic intelligence to become successful. People people who prioritize social skills always have an easier time getting rich than ""things"" people

A lot of these people dont have traditional ""skills"" like when you think of a brilliant person would. But they went all in on working on their ability to relate with people, which is the ultimate network effect I think it comes down to luck and trying to hard. I find some people are lucky in the sense they are more financially better off. For instance, someone can make a very simple product yet appeal to a wide audience for instance one such company the glow stick that keeps fly away hairs back very simple but so many have bought into it.
The intelligent people often overlook these simple yet very good ideas and we look for more data intelligent means of making revenue often ideas that are hard to find Facts:

1 - You rarely see a genuine idea behind a successful business. Most of successful businesses got their early success because of timing + market gap + luck + luck + luck

2 - An intelligent person always tries to evaluate the idea based on its originality, his personal or team's skill to execute it and then try to pour some 'excellence' on top of the whole process. And ignore the most important factor i.e. marketing + timing and luck + luck + luck

3 - If you are an intelligent and mature person , then you will see you don't need 70% of startups/business products in your life. Because you have already figured out how to live your life without those unnecessary products or you have found their free and better alternatives.

4 - On the other hand, the 'little' less intelligent and immature people see those products as a necessity of their lives and hence for others. And they start their business on those ideas.

5 - And lots of other people who either have lots of money or a shortage of neurons , buy those products and make those business successful. Soft skills are more important than a lot of really smart people realize. The best, most innovative, smartest product ever built will not go anywhere without sales people.

I also agree with some other posters about overthinking. Really smart people struggle in certain fields. My FIL is in commercial real estate and builds condos. I could never do this. I would overthink every detail, worry over taxes, try to build the perfect building. I more curdle out this as some fields are ‚Äúbrain‚Äù fields and some fields are ‚Äúballs‚Äù fields and things like real estate are definitely balls over brains. Success is more tied to grit and resilience than it is to talent and intelligence Perfection is a word I‚Äôve eliminated from my vocabulary. I think a lot of people won‚Äôt take action because they are too caught on getting it just right. Evaluate, learn, take action and repeat. My .02 is that they lack emotional intelligence and communication skills that are essential to being successful. After 22 years in my career, I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs not the smartest, most educated/certified, or top producers who make it, it‚Äôs the ones who know how and when to communicate in the proper tone and delivery of message. Anecdotal evidence doesn't support this kind of broad statement. Yes, some highly intelligent people are not successful, and some comparatively less intelligent people are very successful. But studies have shown that IQ has a statistically significant *positive correlation* with academic success, job performance, and overall career success. 

Caveats: IQ is not a perfect measure of intelligence, and not all studies support the correlation above. However, there is still a decent amount of evidence to support it, whereas I have never seen any large studies or analyses showing that more intelligent, talented people are less successful entrepreneurs **on average**. Less intelligent people are more willing to take risks without talking themselves out of it. 

Risk = reward. It's true there are factors that can make someone, at least appear to be, successful that are different from regular measures of talent and intelligence.

I know some people who have built vast fortunes simply by being a nastier bastard than other people.  I know others who have inherited so much privilege and opportunity, they'd need to be a complete muppet not to still be successful.

Then there are the lottery winners, the married-in'ers and the outright thieves and crooks. Talented people are overthinkers. It has a lot to do with other people who devote more energy to bringing others down than to improving themselves. These are the types of people who tend to either stagnate as middle management or fail upwards because they drag the entire team down and it's the easiest way to get rid of them.

If you have three people under you and one does 10% of the work and the other does 60% of the work who are you going to recommend for the promotion? Now what if you're also insecure about your job and worried the high performer is a threat? Overthinking is under feeling. Smart people think too much and winners often are curious and learn by doing it. Sometimes they do it, find something good and keep going. They‚Äôve tried something maybe 50 times while the overthinker is still planning their second attempt. I'm starting a business and I will tell you, after a few months, what I think about. First, I think there is a bit of ""over-moral"" and ""over-thinking"" in every step, that takes time and energy out. But at the end (or at first) the most important part is how to sell ourselves, and that attitude is a bit of a void jump. If I could do something again, would be to focus a lot on sales, the right way to actually start working a lot, intelligent people excel sooner or later in the working part, but most of them ""die"" before actually starting to work. 1. At school nobody liked the girl at the top of the class. It‚Äôs quite often the same in life. 
2. Most people are only interested in how much money you have. Ever heard of fake it til you make it?

‚Ä¢ People aren‚Äôt as successful as you think
‚Ä¢ Lying gets you better results in the short-term Depending on the domains. For some domains, high intelligence is your enemy, because that prevents you from developing deep empathy & intuition for the mass general population. Average people do average people things. If you are highly intelligent, chances are that you don't have the intuition for how they think. It will be hard for you to get into their hearts and be successful. Because you also need to be street smart to get ahead in business. You need to be bold, risk adverse, a great communicator and work with maniacal urgency to be successful as an entrepreneur. Plenty of smart people are great on paper but fail to communicate, lead, market, network, whatever it may be because they don‚Äôt have the people skills.

The charismatic impulsive somewhat narcissistic asshole who has zero books smarts is more likely to have a successful business then someone who‚Äôs incredibly smart just because he‚Äôs more confident in taking the steps to start the business. While the smart guy is still surfing the web for the best possible accounting software to use, the asshole is already selling his product to a random at a bar without anything even set up. 


TLDR: personality or ‚Äústreet smarts‚Äù has a lot to do with it. I‚Äôm confident that if you shared specific examples of ‚Äúdoors open for them with ease‚Äù we would be able to show you why that wasn‚Äôt really the case. 

While macro factors can affect a business (example if you‚Äôre running a successful TikTok shop and ban goes through then that‚Äôs something out of your control) - most of the time it‚Äôs much simpler. 

People tend to start businesses without enough money (aka capital) to fund until the business gets profitable and without any concept of marketing. 

So you might be the most talented person in a skill but if you don‚Äôt know how to make people aware of what you do - you won‚Äôt get customers. 

You also must be very good at managing the business cashflow. 

Finally luck plays a role. 

In summary- successful businesses are built from the combination of talents. And just because you are a superstar at one thing doesn‚Äôt mean you will possess the basic skills to build a business. also smart people tend to be methodical and overly opinionated, resulting in inability to change and adapt.

real world is messy because people are messy. things also happen out of nowhere outside of their control.

being smart doesn't guarantee a way out of the above. So many different variables. Work ethics, doer mentality, salesmanship, confidence, and thats just to note a few. That being said, I know very smart PhDs/scientists/academics who are also financially successful (the type of success you're referring to), so I think it's more soft skills. If you can't put your talent and intelligent to create something useful then your talent is closer to an artist than an entrepreneuer

And we all know most artist are broke I have found that a lot of employers and/or managers tend to promote the people that will be easiest to control. A lot of intelligent, driven, and talented people are consistently nit picked, by the very people that have power over their career growth. I think it stems from insecurity of those in power positions, because they recognize the great ideas and value of those employees. They are threatened by the prospect of someone coming in and out working/thinking them. Talented people might be good at creating products, but a business is multi-facet.

The 2 main pillars to get things off the ground are:

Business is about people and what you can offer them. Showing you understand their pain while creating tension and desire for your products that will help relieve them of this pain.

Economics: it cost money to advertise and get the words out. You must be able to make more in LTV from your solution than what you're spending to acquire the customer.

So basically sales. One theory regarding this topic which I believe is that talented people overthink, they try to find different possibilities which reduces the probability of success but when others just leave it to fate they are left with two options either hit or fail whose probability is 50:50. Still probability of success is 50, on the other hand, the probability of success for an intelligent guy are spread across and are reduced. Now that I think about it...your right. Wow! I wanna know too.ü§î The world tends to reward people that take action, even if they're completely underqualified for the it. This, coupled with the fact that most ""smart"" or intelligent on paper people tend to overthink and overprepare, is the reason why you'll see seemingly ""dumb"" people do great in life. 

Some people may call it recklessness, some high risk-tolerance. 

For most things in life there aren't really too many or significant consequences to failing. As a result, if you're dumb enough to keep fucking up and trying again you'll eventually have something going for you

That isn't to say that if you're intentionally trying as hard as you possibly can, reevaluating your actions when you inevitably fail and go again won't get you even more ahead in life. 

The thing is that either way you'll get the snowball rolling 

Whereas if you're a chronic overthinker and absolutely terrified of any type of risk, you'll most likely get nothing done

I used to be in the latter category and all I gotta say is that if you don't realize this and wake yourself up no one will do it for you most likely. Most people scientifically carry the ""better be safe than sorry"" mentality and as a result even if they see this self destructive mindset in you, they probably won't tell you. Is this selfish? 100% yes. Can you blame them? No. 

You can only blame you if know you fit into the latter category and you do nothing about it. 

I'm not bashing on overthinkers. Just saying that unfortunately this world is built in a way that doers go places and everyone is left behind This is a very complex question but some ppl have different background, some ppl are on the correct medication, and some ppl just land in jail. From dr Peterson says, "" show me your friends and I can tell where your heading"" that line might piss off a lot of ppl but I know for a fact parents can only influence you so much. Your friends truly do so be careful who you hang out with. I agree with FunFerrett2123. Not everyone has the balls to just go for it‚Ä¶. You need a good amount of charisma, timing, and faith in yourself! This sounds like you think of yourself as talented people and got upset that someone else did something cool Youre not talented if you cant pick up the skills you need to thrive.

So much cope in the comments. Those you think have fewer skills or less intelligence are intelligent enough, talented enough, learn quickly and work hard, just like
The group you talk about. The difference is they take action and take risk. They don‚Äôt sit around wondering these things you do, they are too busy making things happen. Fake Grimlock had a great post a long while ago ""Win like stupid"", it explains the phenomenon. [https://readwrite.com/fake-grimlock-win-like-stupid/](https://readwrite.com/fake-grimlock-win-like-stupid/) This is not entirely true, you are over-generalising it. But here are some reasons ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù people might not make it -
1. Overthinking
2. Analysis Paralysis
3. Extremely high standards
4. Inflated ego / superiority complex which breeds arrogance 
5. Desire to stand out (sometimes the easiest way to succeed is to follow the blueprint)

There are many more reasons (personal and external) why people with high intelligence are not able to be successful entrepreneurs. But it is also not true that every successful entrepreneur is stupid or less intelligent, it‚Äôs not about finding the way it‚Äôs about following it. I think of myself this way. I see people succeeding at what I want to do who are less qualified and not to be rude but a lot of times less intelligent and they are doing really well for themselves whereas I am struggling and it‚Äôs because I get in my own head and in my own way. Whereas they just do what needs to be done without overthinking it and without putting much thought into the what ifs. I‚Äôm working on trying to remove myself from the outcome and just taking the steps needed to move in the right direction. Tbh it likely comes down to neurotype. Autistic/ADHD have all the skill and talent and brains. Neurotypicals know how to network and are likeable and therefore get ahead even with no skill. Just shit imbalance. >¬†How much of this is influenced by the surrounding environment, social conditions, or the economic system of a country?

Almost all of it. Case closed. Autism. > How much of this is influenced by the surrounding environment, social conditions, or the economic system of a country?

A lot https://youtu.be/aVZ1sSnIKrg?si=O-SXmMj6fjx-SIyM

Watch this youtube video Intelligence makes you go inward & it makes it difficult to work in a group/team. I think there different definitions of success. If you categorize it financially or socially, maybe what you would see as successful, might seem like a burden for someone else. There's also the problem of being the odd duck out of the pond, when you're friends are finger painting, you're using CSS. Hah! I've known people that are morons in my opinion and did really well in the online business. On the other hand, some of my clients are quite intelligent and had the hardest time making sales. 

I feel it's about action vs being a post-couch potato. I see this in many people where they think they know what to do and then nothing happens. No sales, no income and they are definitely struggling to survive.

Some clients that I signed up with me were actually thriving just fine on their own with me wondering why they are using me and when I asked, one client said she wanted to stay on top of her visitor conversion game.

There is no hard fast rule of why some are thriving and others aren't but it's often like a linked chain. You can have each link or step in your business process working well for you which means those links are strong, but if one link in that chain is weak or broken, it creates a clog and can mean no conversions and sales.

Example 1:

The client was good at identifying her ideal client and was able to market to them properly, she got great engagement but then her offer sucked really bad. When she edited her offer in a more appealing way, it opened the floodgates. The weak link was fixed.

Example 2:

I had one client who had all her links in order except her landing page was terrible. All it did was talk about how great she was and the whole page was overly salesy. When the salesy part was eliminated and turned into an ""info/educational/benefits"" landing page, she started selling right away.

Example 3:

Much like #2, her Facebook page was actually chasing visitors away. The FB cover image was not polished or professional. The content was random and did not lead the visitor on a path of knowledge and many of her visitors would just bounce away. When she eliminated the randomness and created a polished/professional cover image, it took about a week for her to start generating conversions.

Sometimes we believe they know what to do or just give it their best shot. Some of those that thrive may have had help you don't know about whether they're talented or not. Some do well because they did a good job learning on their own.

So the only thing you can do if you are experiencing a ""Lack Of Thriving"" is to get help based on where you think your weak links are. Hope that makes sense! ""Talent"" doesn't equate to ""goal"".  A very ""talented"" doctor can make a lot of money BUT ONLY if that doctor has a 'goal' to retire by 40, then that doctor will use his/her 'talent' to achieve that 'goal'. Talented ppl tend to overthink over-analuze everything, like everything, while people with goals just keep hustling, taking quick action, fail-fast, re-adjust and keep moving. Talented people may not take actions and wait for things to happen/show up so that they can show their talent, while there's always action happening in people with goals.. Well just my 2 cents Analysis paralysis 3. There are many people who have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. They would rather promote the thick and useless over the person at the top of the class. One is an engineer, the other sees the vision and takes steps together. Most inventors and engineers are the first one. thinking more is bad for taking action

it‚Äôs why brave heroes in movies are always dumber 

it‚Äôs why kings were never the smartest guy at the time

it‚Äôs why entrepreneurs are more conservative 

getting money involves taking money from somewhere, if you‚Äôre always considerate of that where then it make it a lot harder to do things

smart people theorize, dumber people execute and there‚Äôs probably some eusocial/biological benefit for our species at large for it Some people often think they know best, hence sometimes things don't sell as THEY expect. Smart people work that out and change approach.

Smart is not defined by IQ or skills, it's about being open to learning. Those who already think they're 'Smart' don't need to learn any more...right? It's not necessarily about talent. I know talented people that struggle to deliver results. Talent can be seen in different ways. The most morally and ethically flexible people I know are the most financially successful I know. That‚Äôs my anecdotal take. To be able to reap the rewards of success = Intelligence + human relations + marketing, + show off + creating demand

I think different approaches are needed than intelligence to be able to reap the rewards of success. This is where concepts like philosophy of life, genetic transmissions, teachings and adaptability come into play.

It is about wanting money and power. Most intelligent people experience enough a sense of satisfaction when they achieve the desired results. apparently theyre not talented in being successful üòÇ Agree Dunning Kruger effect Being an entrepreneur is about taking action. As long as you have got some common sense, you can make it. True, it‚Äôs not all about hard work and intelligence. A lot of success comes down to factors like access to resources, mentorship, and sometimes even luck. If you can tap into those, it can make all the difference in breaking through the financial barriers! I think it has to do with childhood and up ringing. Lots of people who are excellent at productivity usually had great childhoods and entrepreneurship requires the right amount of grit, attitude, ruthlessness and  other qualities that aren't usually rewarded in a normal work setting. Givers & Takers.

Dumber they are, the more they take.

The smarter they are, the more they realize the need for empathy in a society and that makes them soft and they get taken advantage of.

""Just do it"" doesn't  have the time to become smart, then they come across the smart ones and exploit them. 




Right, Elon? Many times the best entrepreneurs are really good at both ‚Äúbuilding‚Äù and ‚Äúselling‚Äù. If a founder lacks the skills for one of these, it can be solved with a cofounder or partner. 

Simply being smart and intelligent at building does not equal success. Building can involve designing and developing complex architecture systems or even building something simple through no-code. 

Yet, for a business to thrive one must still ‚Äúsell‚Äù their solution whether through sales, marketing, partnerships, recruiting, attracting investors, etc. This requires a different set of soft skill like reading people, asking the right questions to understand their problems, connecting the dots from problem to solution space, conveying the right message, etc. 

People are social creatures and still buy from other people even if it‚Äôs not their personal money (i.e B2B). As a builder, it‚Äôs easy to forget this part and try to automate everything around sales and marketing when sometimes it requires you to be social and just talk to customers, partners, investors, recruits. 

‚ÄúAlways be selling.‚Äù smart means nothing just actiob Entrepreneurship is about risk, hard work, and cleverness. Talent and intelligence is surely useful, but not a requirement. 

I‚Äôd think people who are very talented and intelligent from a young age are not required to take as many risks, work as hard, or find as many clever solutions in life. Because their school, tests, and jobs come fairly easy to them. 

If you have to work extremely hard to get your test scores up, find clever ways to make money because you didn‚Äôt get into a college that makes a high paying job easily accessible, and take risks because less opportunities are available - you are in a better place to develop those skills.

Of course you can do all these things when you are talented and intelligent and have ample opportunities as well, but it‚Äôs less necessary. You can be comfortable without. Financial literacy is a skill you need to learn and then you still need discipline to implement what you've learned.

None of this has to do with general intelligence nor being talented in a specific thing. 

Furthermore consumer habbits are mostly emotional, and just because someone is highly intelligent or good at something, doesn't mean they are emotionally healthy or have reasonable coping mechanisms. Is there actual evidence beyond this personal anecdote? I don't think it's more of why we struggle, but more of how we struggle. Being talented means your ego comes into play and you neglect other things which in return ends up eating and overwhelming you causing you to fail and struggle. It's okay to be talented, but to make use of that talent you have to negate or outsource the areas that will make your life easier. I think the confusion here is that ‚Äúsmart‚Äù implies you‚Äôre smart about everything.  If we purely look at financial intelligence, that requires a set of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù skills that a book typically wont teach.  For example, being smart about saving your money instead of buying dumb shit.  Many of the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù people I know think because they ‚Äúmade it‚Äù and are ‚Äúsmart‚Äù can do anything.  Truth is they can‚Äôt and being wealthy doesn‚Äôt necessarily require you to be book smart.  Grit takes you where you want to go. Because talent has little to do with success compared to determination to solve a problem despite repeated failures ‚ÄúSurvival of the fittest isn‚Äôt about who is strongest or smartest, but who can adapt the quickest.‚Äù

It doesn‚Äôt matter how smart you are if you‚Äôre too stubborn to adapt to a changing market. Skill sets?

I'm usually the smartest guy in the building, yet I'm so close to non functional in so many ways it's ridiculous. I do some things VERY well, and most other things not so well.

Entrepreneurship for me has been a struggle of gaining new skills. Pushing myself to level up existing skills, while working on learning the skills needed for the business side of things. Ideation is not my issue. :) Those intelligent people sit on their ass and conceptualize while I go get it done.  I‚Äôm hungry, they are not. Luck plays a huge part in all of our lives. At least some successful people admit that. I have the mindset of everything is figuroutable. Doesn‚Äôt need to be perfect but a step in some direction is a step forward Read- Rich Dad, Poor Dad. Talent is given to you, work ethic is earned. When you have an advantage in how fast you learn, it‚Äôs a bit of a poison when you expect things to be easy all the time. Things always get more complicated into learning a skill.

I have had talent with pretty much every interest I‚Äôve had and noticed this pattern with myself, eventually you learn to just accept that nothing is easy when you‚Äôre trying to master some skill. Overthinking! Are we all missing the point and reality here, it's not what you know but who you know. Talent alone doesn‚Äôt make anyone thrive.    This is a HUGE misconception people that think they are talented have.   It‚Äôs the grinding on the stuff no one likes doing that makes the difference Some people are too naive and too stupid and too unaware to be blocked by things that may block talented people.

Trauma and life experiences will affect how you respond to opportunities and adversity. It will form your risk tolerance and your courage. 

I‚Äôm a total loser as I‚Äôm neither talented and am too held back by my anxieties and worries and life circumstances to do anything daring. Overthinking.

I‚Äôm somewhat this type‚Ä¶ Intelligent people will talk themselves out of a lopsided risk/reward ratio on a huge opportunities and unfortunately, success in business (especially in the startup phase) is often times found when you win a risky gamble.

The analytical brain will not allow smart guys to take massive risks based on instinct. And executing on a less risky plan leads to a loss or severely diminished reward to risk ratio.

That‚Äôs why you see the smart executive type guys thrive at the top of bigger, more established businesses. When the business enters a phase where it‚Äôs matured, and has the resources and manpower to ensure survival, the company growth no longer relies on taking big risks, but rather calculated risks and and well executed plans. Entrepreneurship requires a specific set of talents and skills that being smart doesn‚Äôt necessarily equate to. You can be the most athletic person in the world, but it doesn‚Äôt mean you have the specific type of athleticism required to be a top swimmer Some people in any cohort will struggle.

>Are there hidden factors at play? I‚Äôd love to hear your perspectives and experiences.

None of the factors are hidden. Talent and intelligence accomplish nothing without direction and action. If you're insanely intelligent and talented but do nothing all day, of course you're going to struggle. There's no magic here - people need a direction and action in order to accomplish anything. Why would you try 1+2? You aren‚Äôt an imbecile are you? Because acquiring skill takes a lot of time. It's not the most direct way to get money. (if that's what you mean by thrive, getting money.) [https://headbutler.com/reviews/drama-gifted-child/](https://headbutler.com/reviews/drama-gifted-child/)

They have a lot of complex trauma responses. The more intelligent you are the harder it will be at times to get real work done and be productive. It's why cats are incredibly smart but also very scared of their surroundings. It's why cats and humans are so anxious all the time. If you know all the risks, you're going to be hesitant; if you know all the work and long hours something entails, you are going to be hesitant. That's human nature. Being able to look that in the face and be like, yeah, 120 hours a week for the next 2-3 years sounds great, with little rest, little communication with the family, but it's what I need to do to succeed. The idea behind any business is less than half the battle; everything comes down to implementation and the market. If you can corner a good section of the market and implement it correctly, generally, you can achieve ""success"".The idea behind any business is less than half the battle; everything comes down to implementation and the market. Cfbr some people can do the grinding tedious work Focus/ discipline Perfectionism? Or a lack of initiative and hard work required they lack from being gifted? The perceived less skilled types have a work ethic ingrained in them from a young age. It‚Äôs the only way they know how‚Ä¶ Mental resilience.

No matter how smart you are - you will get kicked to the kerb repeatedly.

Your ability to stand back up is vastly more important than another 5-10 IQ points. The smartest, most creative and talented people I know tend to be the laziest I know as well. Laziness doesn‚Äôt translate to lucrative careers... But it‚Äôs annoying because I‚Äôm a goddamn idiot and everything takes me forever to finish, because I want to be lazy and I hate doing stuff So there's a few things here. I'm going to make the statement gardeners multiple intellects here, and use the term ""classical intelligence"" to denote book smart, but I will return to that at the end. 

The first thing is people buy from people they trust and people trust people just like them. That in itself is not really a particularly controversial statement, until you realize that this means that most successful sales and business people are basically selling to their own avatars ( or more correctly, customers are buying from their own avatars). Not necessarily in demography, but in the way they think, the way they do small talk, the places they've been to, the interests they have, the sports they play etc which is why so many people play golf and make decisions there, and so many people smoke and make decisions there. It's also why you're often taught in sales to find commonality and talk around that. 

The second thing to recall is that the business world doesn't need to sell to the smartest members of the cohort. You make money selling to the most, or at least a big share of, the market. Conventional talented and classically intelligent people are not the majority of the market. By far the minority. At best you're looking at 2% of your addressable market. So you will saturated it really quickly. 

Given that logical, it leaves two key things that in business, drive why talented smart people don't make it. 

Their avatar is people just like them come up with if they are one in a hundred then they need 200 people to find another person just like them and this means they have to do 200 times the work to sell a product targeted at them come on compared to somebody selling their general public. The odds of closing a sale are bad enough already without having to self-destruct like that. 

But the crux is that customers buy from people who trust and trust people just like them. This means it's basically impossible for an intelligent or talented person to be able to make significant money. There isn't the time in their lifetime. 

Why are they trying to sell goods to the top 1% of people who are intelligent, while ignoring the 99%? They're literally closing their entire market by doing that. 

Talent and intelligence, especially if it's nurtured independent of interactions with others, leads to a detached individual sure come on but it also means they have been shielded from the politics and other tools of incompetence the develop in organizations around them this is especially keyware individuals have been so Talented the managers have deliberately chosen to shield them from the politics by employing someone to deal with that or by the themselves preventing access to the Talent come on and the entire career of the target person has evolved to exclude the politics. When it comes to consultancy and contracting, this has huge positives for the individual but that also moves them away from conventional business. So they become detached from it. 

Side effect of that come on is the individual is extremely capable of self-actualizing. In the sense that they can take to Heart any ethical common moral or existential questions associated with their own principles. So as a result they think they can play a straight road come up but they have been shielded from the politics that derails them. And this is why it's so successful that politicians simply derail intelligence or factual positions for stop and we see that in elections all the time these days and there's almost nothing that can be done to put the train back on the Tracks once that's happened. Because people have then lost trust in them when they were operating for a position of low Trust anyway come on because they are classically intelligent and the customer is not. 

Now, I've deliberately used the term ""classical"" intelligence in this comment because that type of intellect is only one of around eight different identified intellects that people have. Which are at the last count:

1. Mathematical Logical 
2. Linguistic 
3. Visio-Spatial 
4. Interpersonal - how to relate to others 
5. Musical 
6. Body-Kinaesthetic (think soccer players or contemporary dancers. Anything sport for sure) 
7. Intrapersonal - how someone relates to themselves
8. Moral-Existential 
9. Naturalistic 

The first three of those only are considered classical intelligence as measured by IQ scores. But seals and business skills actually need numbers for, 7, and maybe 8 and 9 depending on whether you're in non-profit business, social enterprises , or government. 

So if the intelligent individual does not have the ability to overlap with those other four, then there is no reasonable why they would be any more successful at it then the average Joe, and if they have been on lucky enough not to be exposed to it their entire career then they will actually be significantly worse. Because many of the interpersonal skills around failure come up which most people learn quite young, intelligent people may never have learned and they don't like it when it happens to them. So when you're trying to build and sell a business, failure is the thing that cripples them command the way they deal with that is the go to the topics they find most comforting, which is usually the places that they have traditionally excelled at

This is a super important point! 

Business is invariably going to include failures. Even if you do everything right on your side, your customer may fail to pay you on time, or you may fail to get investment. It has nothing to do with you but a lot of people who have been through the superintelligence piece come on tend to find that difficult because they have always evaluated themselves against their own yardsticks or a fixed yardstick that everybody else has to be evaluate against. An objective measure, basically (eg Degree or Masters exam scores). 

So the reason why, is it's a whole system problem [for them]. Consistency Can‚Äôt teach leadership Most of them have Analysis Paralysis and they don't even know. Because they have capital and family money and assests  and  pple to lean on in the background. Talent alone is always a struggle. Talent without money defines struggle. How many of us have ideas and just need that money to make it a reality. 
I have written children‚Äôs books id love to publish and things drawn that I would l would love to get made and get on the market but I dont have the money, I just have great ideas and talent. It's because of one very important and crucial emotion that been instilled in the so called talented people and it's called fear.

Whereas the uneducated or less talented people have lesser fear and hence are able to take greater risks which in turn privides higher rewards. Luck is part of the equation. Right place right time. As an entrepreneur too smart can be a liability. Entrepreneurship often requires an immense amount of unpaid  hard work and sacrifice, not just high IQ and It's certainly not for 9-5 workers either. Some people have a million great ideas and focus on none of them. 

Others have one great idea. It‚Äôs all they‚Äôve got. They approach it with tunnel-vision and focus on that one thing. Intelligence and social skills are 2 different areas of life. There are other things that hold people back, like beliefs, past trauma, social context, etc. Intelligence is not a guarantee for success, as many intelligent people excel in one area/domain but are limited in others. Some intelligent people are often very arrogant or feel superior to others, which is rarely a good way to build successful connections and evolve in life. Think athletes. You can have all the talent in the world but if you don‚Äôt have the drive, it‚Äôs wasted. This is such an insightful question, and there are definitely several factors at play when it comes to why some talented or intelligent people struggle while others seem to thrive. While individual skills and hard work are important, there are often hidden or external factors that can heavily influence success. Here are some key things to consider:

1. **Social and Networking Skills**: Success in many fields, especially in entrepreneurship, is often tied to who you know just as much as what you know. Some people are natural networkers, able to form relationships and make connections that open doors. Others, despite being incredibly talented, may not have the social skills or opportunities to build those essential networks, which can limit their chances for advancement.
2. **Opportunity and Access**: People who come from privileged backgrounds or have access to certain resources (financial, social, educational, etc.) are often more likely to succeed, even if they don't have the same level of talent or intelligence as others. The environment you grow up in can have a huge impact‚Äîif you‚Äôre surrounded by people who have the capital, connections, or knowledge to help you succeed, you‚Äôre more likely to thrive.
3. **Risk Tolerance and Mindset**: Entrepreneurs often succeed because they‚Äôre willing to take risks, even if they don‚Äôt have all the information or experience. Some people with high intelligence or talent might be more risk-averse, or they might be more focused on perfection and less inclined to take chances. This can cause them to miss out on opportunities that others are willing to seize.
4. **Economic Systems and Structures**: The economic system of a country can definitely play a role in determining who thrives and who struggles. For example, capitalist economies tend to reward people who can take risks and generate wealth, even if they don't have the deepest expertise in a given area. In contrast, more socialized or regulated economies might provide a stronger safety net for those who have specialized skills or knowledge but may not thrive in entrepreneurial environments.
5. **Luck and Timing**: Sometimes success just boils down to being in the right place at the right time. Markets or trends can shift, and someone might find themselves in a position to take advantage of that moment, even if their skills aren‚Äôt necessarily the most refined. In contrast, even a talented person can struggle if they‚Äôre in the wrong place at the wrong time.
6. **Mental Health and Resilience**: Success also hinges on mental fortitude‚Äîresilience in the face of setbacks, perseverance through challenges, and the ability to manage stress and failure. Sometimes, highly intelligent or talented individuals face self-doubt, perfectionism, or imposter syndrome, which can prevent them from taking bold action or capitalizing on opportunities.

In the end, it's not just about talent or intelligence‚Äîit‚Äôs a combination of opportunity, timing, risk-taking, networking, and sometimes just pure luck. There are certainly systemic factors at play that impact who gets ahead and who struggles. Success can be seen as a mix of internal qualities, external factors, and circumstances that align in a way that creates opportunities for growth.

I had this problem my background is computer science, but it became less of a problem after I got a job in sales. U learn to deal with rejection and adapt quickly. That eventually starts happening in other parts of your life Talent is not enough.

If you know how to surround yourself with smart people and delegate commands from a BoD you can be a CEO Few fallacies in here, the one being smart people overthink‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so random who starts a business, I don‚Äôt think there is a one size fits all person who does it either. I've worked for financially successful people most of my life (i build high end homes as a finish carpenter).  The only consistent characteristic they all have (aside from old money people, that's different) is they are persistent.  Often psychotically so.  Don't need to be smart or talented (although some are) but they are ALL relentless in their aims.  Ethics and morality is usually not a consideration. Get it done, do it well and focus on the most critical task. Thats what ive done and im talented and smart and things are going decent Talented people struggle at what they‚Äôre not talented in. Because talented people over think and the others go with the flow üòÇ Damm I m Perhaps the definition of success/thriving is different for those with high intelligence and talent because the gain of material things are not what they define as important in their lives. Some of the most well lived lives left this earth with very little but impacted many a life. People think that talent and intelligence is responsible for success, but in reality it's just the factor that *most of the population doesn't have*.

It requires a lot more than that: namely, opportunity, good health, and the various factors that go into proper motivation.

If you spent your whole life in the desert you might think that all you need for plant growth is water, because it's the limiting factor there. But plants need more than just water. They're just more talented at marketing - the most important business skill You don‚Äôt have to be a fry cook to run a hamburger joint.

What is the ‚Äúsecret sauce‚Äù that makes one stand out? Mindset, that leads to overthinking. I think that it is because talented and people that were successful in the school or university tend to be more risk averse and prefer to have a secure but not crazy lucrative job.

On the other hand, I have seen some people that struggled in school that started their own ‚Äúsimple‚Äù business (e.g. contractor services) because they were not as suitable for the job market and basically had nothing to lose. However, there is some survivorship bias in your view as you pay more attention to the successful cases of non-skilled people while most of them could be struggling as well. I wonder this as well for fields outside of entrepreneurship. It seems like for some people things just work out, and for others its a constant struggle - even for people with the same education and similar opportunities. I'm not sure why. For example, someone I know just seemed to make all the right choices to get her into her current position - although she didn't necessarily know at the time of her decisions that they would work out so well. Yeah I‚Äôve been out of work for 3 years. I‚Äôm a web designer, developer, marketing consultant (23 years). I‚Äôm also an artist, musician that was in a band 2005-2010 signed to a major record label in 2009-2010 and on alternative rock radio. I was in politics in 2019-2022 and I‚Äôve met a POTUS and First Lady and been thanked personally for my work. I‚Äôve been on tv. I started and owned a super pac. I‚Äôve done all kinds of stuff and I used to bill out from $150-$250/hr, but I‚Äôve been out of work for 3 years. I‚Äôve always been like this going through fits and starts. A lot of how you get money, smart people feel is ""beneath them"" or they come up with other excuses. 

A lot of money making is literally just doing the work. 

That whole ""work smarter not harder"" shit is a cancer to smart people. They do like 1/100 of the effort needed because they're trying to ""figure it out"" when it's like - just do the reps. 

I like running and lifting analogies. You don't ""figure out"" how to run a marathon, you just fucking run it and it fucking sucks every step but you just do it. A lot of making money is like that. A Toyota Corolla that actually makes it to the finish line will always beat a Ferrari that stays in the garage. They are not that smart. My definition of smart is someone who is able to get the things they want. If they cannot achieve that goal they are not smart. You can apply Newtons 3rd law of motion to find the answer. Just switch ""Action"" for ""ability.""

""Within the Human mind For every Ability, there is an equal and opposite inability."" 

Cool huh? Has the added benefit of being psychologically and neurologically sound. 

üôÇü§îüòÉüí™ Support, luck, and environment are the main answers aside from mental liabilities Hi, I‚Äôm one of those. It‚Äôs ADHD and Autism. Common sense It's not about whether they are talented or not instead about consistency. Even a Dumb person can succeed just by being consistent. Ego and overconfidence or...

A man with hammer to him very problem seems like a nail. Cause they actually aren't that talented. Imho you should reevaluate how you perceive ‚Äútalent‚Äù in other people if the desired outcome of entrepreneurship is success üòâ

No offense intended but I feel that you might diminish the value of what you perceive in some other people as ‚Äúdumb luck‚Äù while you think that being highly intelligent and very laborious is the way to go for being a successful entrepreneur. 

I think successful entrepreneurship requires bravery (taking chances while others see no value), stress resilience (I don‚Äôt care about initial rejection from the market, investors, pressure from my social environment) and network on top of working hard and being (somewhat) intelligent. 

Have witnessed this a couple of times in different people I know that became successful‚Ä¶ and believe me some were definitely not in the upper 25% cognitively üòâ Because sometimes it takes luck Yep :(.  Always has been a struggle.  But I‚Äôve learned many things along the 

Some people say we can see reality at a deeper more indifferent level. Most smart people aren't successful because they care too much. They can learn anything in a short period of time but they lack agency (the ability to execute). 
On the other hand, if you tell a normal or not so smart person that they are going to make a lot of money doing that one thing, and guess what? They will believe there's nothing stopping them. 

We tend to overthink things so much that it becomes so difficult for us to actually start doing that ""thing"". 

I've seen more extraordinary people starve than ordinary people. Because talented people take longer. The old saying that ""perfect is the enemy of good enough"" really hits them hardest. I learned the hard way that being highly intelligent and talented makes it hard to find employment because companies don‚Äôt want to pay for those skills. They‚Äôd rather hire a less skilled person, train them, and promote them because it‚Äôs cheaper than someone who already has those skills.  

I tell people all the time that I had to start my own business to find steady employment. I‚Äôve had employers tell me that my resume was impressive but they couldn‚Äôt afford me. It‚Äôs a great compliment to have but not when you‚Äôre living at home with your parents, getting government assistance, and struggling to pay medical expenses. Most of my former classmates never had any trouble finding work like me because their skills were middle enough to get hired anywhere they wanted. Interesting piece from the Risale-i Nur:
Truly, because trees are powerless and without will in their need for sustenance, they remain steadfast in their trust in God, while their provision rushes towards them. The nourishment of helpless infants flows from marvelous milk-producing sources directly into their mouths, yet this milk supply ceases as soon as the infants develop some strength and a limited will. Similarly, human children, in particular, are granted motherly compassion as a form of support. All these phenomena clearly demonstrate that lawful sustenance is not tied to power or will, but rather is granted in accordance with aspects that inspire trust in God: weakness and helplessness.

The primary cause of frustrations arising from greed is formed by power, will, and intelligence. Although these aspects compelled some great literary figures to use their literary talents for begging, the powerless resignation of many untalented, uncultivated, and underdeveloped individuals brought them wealth. Furthermore, the saying ‚ÄúThe paths of a knowledgeable person are obstructed, while an ignorant person is found to be sustained‚Äù has become proverbial. This demonstrates that lawful sustenance cannot be obtained or pursued through power and will. It is granted based on grace for the effort and labor exerted; it is bestowed out of compassion for the needs of the individual in question. We also live in a somewhat ‚Äústupid‚Äù world, just see a lot of influencers getting rich without any talent or knowledge. Our time also rewards mediocrity quite a bit. As entrepreneur, I work so hard, i never get tired of my work and learning everything i need to know to run my business all by myself, but ten years later and i am still not making this a successful business. I think
The risk aversion is my issue. I never felt comfortable borrowing the money to hire help, so i can propel this business to the next level. I never found someone as passionate about my business to jump in snd help me move it to the next level. Alignment with one's true innate purpose and being able to steer toward internal fulfillment = Lifes greatest superpower

Misalignment with purpose and clocking in somewhere thats not that... despite intelligence or aptitude = Lifes path to mental health derailment

cant fight it I don't think ""talented"" people struggle more than others.

Consider this:

1. ""Talented"" people are ‚Äì usually by definition ‚Äì a minority.
2. ""Successful"" people are ‚Äì again usually by definition ‚Äì a minority.
3. Assuming there's not a strong relationship between being ""talented"" and being ""successful"" ‚Äì and that's what you should assume by default ‚Äì you'd expect to see the set of ""successful"" people composed by only a minority of ""talented"" people.

The last point is what I think is giving you the impression that ""talented people struggle while others thrive"".

But unless you have strong evidence that the likelihood of being talented among successful people is considerably lower than the likelihood of being talented among people in general... what you're observing is actually perfectly normal and it does not mean that talented people struggle more than others :) 1. The people you ‚Äúthink‚Äù aren‚Äôt that smart or ‚Äúless intelligent‚Äù actually possesses loads of skills and are extremely intelligent in their field. Don‚Äôt let your ego delude you 
2. You‚Äôre talking book smarts, which is often correlated with high success in academia, which means your whole life you haven‚Äôt been accustomed to dealing with failure. For you anything less than 90% is cause for anxiety and thinking you suck, in biz a 10% conversation rate is top .0001% lol 
3. You don‚Äôt respect the game enough. Put in more work, you‚Äôre not as smart as you think Dumb enough to take a risk when the odds are against you. Stubborn enough not to quit when it gets hard. Talented people are wanted by employers so they have options other than going out alone. I doubt on average they are struggling as much as you think.  You also might think they are talented when they are not. most of the people who are struggling all have one thing in common and that is they lack sales and marketing skills. They can‚Äôt accept people who doesn‚Äôt think like them 80% emotional, 20% work and talent Street smart vs book smart I don‚Äôt care how cheesy this is because this is the answer. Press On is the slogan & the famous quote below explains it. CC was a G.

 ‚ÄúNothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.‚Äù

Calvin Coolidge Success is often about connections, timing, and luck, not just talent. Soft skills and adaptability can matter as much as hard work or smarts. We are good at rationalizing bad decisions and overthinking They tend to be tired or don't want to go out and do something. IMO to put it simply - to be successful you have to put yourself in a position to achieve success. A lot of intelligent people know what they have to do, but they just aren‚Äôt willing to do it. 

Basically, intelligence is not the #1 determining characteristic of success. In my opinion, it‚Äôs not even top 5. I think the more important characteristics are discipline/grit, ability to sell yourself/influence others, high risk tolerance, and high sense of urgency Above all, it takes audacity and often nerve. The rest is easy after that. A lot of successful people hire people with intelligence and knowledge. Successful people are often good at decision making, organisational skills, and risk management. Drive>talent 

Drive+talent>everything else

Nepotism>Drive+talent+everything else I think a lot of it comes down to timing, luck, and the network you have around you. Sometimes, people with less ""formal"" talent can thrive because they‚Äôre in the right place at the right time, or they have the confidence to take risks others might not. And let‚Äôs be real society doesn‚Äôt always reward hard work or intelligence in the ways we expect. Some people just know how to play the game, while others might not have the same resources or connections to push them forward. If someone struggles, it often indicates a lack of trust‚Äîwhether in themselves, in opportunities, or in the unknown. 

Trust is essential because it creates confidence and energy to act decisively. Without trust, even intelligence and hard work can falter. 

Success is often more about manifesting opportunities through belief and action at the right time than relying solely on raw talent or intelligence. Because with talent, you need hard work, luck, and faith. Because their talent is not in what you need to thrive. Some people just know how to play the game, even if they‚Äôre not the smartest or most talented. It‚Äôs about timing, connections, and knowing when to take risks. Talent is cool but you gotta have the right environment to make it work. All of those factors but a big one you missed is genetics and hormones. it is more likely that lightning strikes a person once than the same person twice There‚Äôs so much more to ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù than raw intelligence or talent. You can be the smartest person in the room, but if you don‚Äôt have the right connections, social skills, or even just the grit to push past failure, you might end up spinning your wheels. Here are a few factors that can tip the scale:
	1.	Networking & Social Capital
	‚Ä¢	Sometimes it‚Äôs not what you know but who you know. People with strong networks or supportive families often get introduced to opportunities (jobs, investors, mentors) that others simply never see.
	2.	Risk Tolerance & Action
	‚Ä¢	Highly analytical or perfectionist-minded folks can get trapped in overthinking or waiting for ‚Äúthe perfect moment.‚Äù Meanwhile, someone with less ‚Äúraw talent‚Äù might just jump in, hustle, fail fast, and learn. That bias toward action can pay off big-time.
	3.	Mindset & Confidence
	‚Ä¢	Being brilliant but self-doubting can hold you back. On the flip side, someone with average skills but sky-high confidence can pitch and sell themselves more effectively. A strong belief in yourself (even if it‚Äôs a bit delusional) can open more doors than genius that stays hidden.
	4.	Access & Environment
	‚Ä¢	If you grow up in a resource-rich environment, your path can be smoother‚Äîbetter schools, safer neighborhoods, or parents who can bankroll your experiments. Conversely, even if you‚Äôre incredibly talented, you might be stuck in a place with minimal job opportunities or capital access.
	5.	Soft Skills
	‚Ä¢	Emotional intelligence, communication, and relationship-building can be just as important as IQ. A great idea or talent goes nowhere if you can‚Äôt communicate its value or rally people behind you.
	6.	Persistence & Adaptability
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúLuck‚Äù often follows those who keep at it, pivot quickly when things fail, and don‚Äôt beat themselves up over setbacks. Some hyper-intelligent people struggle with failure because they‚Äôre used to being right; they may crumble when faced with real-world rejection or chaos.

Basically, intelligence and hard work matter, but success is often about combining them with hustle, networking, emotional resilience, and sometimes just being in the right place at the right time. This is the answer. I remember reading that the number one skill you need to have as an entrepreneur is not smarts but resilience. You will have to try things over and over and over again and you have to not get knocked down if things don‚Äôt work.

I‚Äôve tried to help a lot of friends start their businesses and the ones who are really tied up and being smart are the ones who struggle the most because they overthink everything. And when something doesn‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs like they get frozen and can‚Äôt move on. A lot of them are also extremely inflexible.

I have a friend that takes notes on every word that you say because she‚Äôs taught that education is so important but when it comes to thinking outside of the box and being creative, she really gets stuck because she‚Äôs afraid to fail. 

A lot of really smart people take failure to heart. It‚Äôs not ‚Äòtalent‚Äô or ‚Äòsmarter‚Äô. 

Some of the most blunt, sales-like men have become CEOs and entrepreneurs. It‚Äôs talent in different ways. 

What you mean is academic or introverts tend to overthink or over engineer. This was going to be my answer. I‚Äôm in tax and some of the highest earners are people who just gun it and run it and don‚Äôt stop‚Ä¶ problem is there are plenty of those types that crash and burn spectacularly bad. I once told someone what good martial artists and successful business people have in common is we keep getting back up. Came here to say this! 

I have Asperger‚Äôs and one of the side effects is that we tend to be highly intelligent. But give us a task without parameters and we‚Äôll be over engineering, over thinking, and questioning everything and basically getting nowhere. Exactly. Even in a well managed and skilled team with a very specific project, ""scope creep"" is a killer. A person tired of hammering a square peg into a round hole will simply either round the peg or square the hole. A person contemplating the activity may propose a variety of pegs, a variety of holes, alternatives to a hammer, expansions to improve peg extractability, etc Linus Sebastian of Linus Tech Tips had a good quote on this:

‚ÄúExecution is everything. Sitting around and planning is worthless unless it turns into something tangible. 

You‚Äôre better off to have 100% execution of a 50% plan than 50% execution of a 100% plan. 

Nothing drives me crazier than sitting around pontificating about ‚Äúthe perfect way to do something‚Äù when we‚Äôre in a hurry, which is always if you want to get anything done.‚Äù Spot on! Struggling with this myself! 

Still got projects and ideas that are not yet perfect for me to launch yet! It wasn't a smart person who looked at Everest and said ""that seems like a good idea"" The curse of analytical thinking: inaction¬† Just want to caveat off this that people of seemingly 'lower intelligence' but the drive to make something are more willing to accept risk and roll with the punches as they come. does this mean that the people who spend time thinking about this question before coming up with an answer are more likely mid entrepreneurs while those who imediately have an answer are ""better"" entrepreneurs? üëÄ Correct the time it takes a talented person to figure it out the other person done put some stuff together üòâ I believe this at some point This. Smart people get in their own way. It‚Äôs usually fear, the mind killer. True Also people tend to overestimate their talent I would call those entrepreneurs, just ""Big Freelancers"". Real entrepreneurs, who are disruptors, try to find a balance between overthinking and implementation. Their goal is to challenge the status quo. A few succeed, dozens ""die"" along the way, and others succeed because they are tired of changing the systems and in the end just go with the flow Also, people skills.   Business success is 80% just charisma and people skills. This is something I struggle with. I see so many competitors making wild claims about what they can do, and selling like crazy. Meanwhile I am very careful about making any claims about how successful or helpful my software will be. It leads to really dull marketing. I hate the idea of misleading people though. A very realistic approach to see how things work! Thanks a lot It really sucks but unfortunately this is how I see it too. You can be incredibly intelligent and talented at what you do. You can provide a really great service/product and be resilient for years while overcoming obstacles and adversity in attempt to provide the best service you can. But if an inferior service/product comes along with better sales and marketing they will thrive 10x more than you will in a fraction of the time. Reading an Elon Musk biography currently. His fails more regularly than any one I have ever studied before. When things are going good he starts looking for something to do where failure is the most likely outcome. When he dives into trying to do the stupidly impossible, failure of hitting his ridiculous objectives is with him every step of the way.

I think he thrives on chaos and failure. I don‚Äôt think he ever really accepts winning when he wins. Ooof. This explains so much why I hate marketers and growth ‚Äúhackers‚Äù. Yes definitely, I tried dropshipping once, bought an expensive course, set everything up and started advertising. After my first order came in it didn't feel good, the opposite actually. It felt really bad. 

So I stopped immediately. Now I am starting a business in real estate photography where I want to mainly focus on customer satisfaction, I want to keep everything as transparent as can be, they aren't happy with what I delivered? I will just refund the money or offer a free reshoot. 

It will be a lot harder, and earn a lot less money. But I won't feel bad while doing it which is the most important :) This is PRECISELY the first thought that came to mind. 

Sadly, those that seem to be making the most at the moment are ‚Äúinvestment companies‚Äù gutting previously flourishing businesses. It‚Äôs a disease. Yup, I always feel icky when someone offers me money for a service. I believe in mutualism over capitalism, which conflicts with my needs for money in the current system. I am guilty of this. Whenever we do promo/coupon/special I am looking out for the customer first. I hate weird stipulations like only valid between certain times on certain days etc. Ya got someone who actually wants to come use your promo, don't make it hard on them Why the potshot at marketing? There are plenty of ethical people working ethically in marketing. Unless you mean people who lie/deceive about their product, or traction, or other factors that help them capture customers and secure investment. And in that case, instead of saying ""read: marketing"" add a little nuance.

*Edit: Down votes for a thoughtfully stated invective-free answer informed by nearly 3 decades in business? Right on. Maybe most of the time you need to be impulsive, I mean 99% of regular business opportunities require more action than thinking Or the college kid who literally sold POTATOES with a handwritten note, and made 5 figures overnight. Or the pet rocks guy. Jesus christ. Gotta say though, I can't think of another pillow brand name. The idea might have been risky, but his marketing is smart. This. Measuring smartness with numbers is like measuring universe in kilometres. You dont get sense of what it is . 
Nerdy/Smart people are just goos with given perimeters True! THIS. üëÜüèºI was looking for this! I have a background in Business Analysis and this is exactly what it‚Äôs about. Spend a small amount of time/money up front (cheap) so you have a better chance at executing a plan successfully without costly mistakes. Scope the project so you avoid scope creep. 

You don‚Äôt need to reinvent the wheel. Find someone out there who is successful and take the time to learn what‚Äôs working and what‚Äôs not (invest in yourself). Leaders especially. 

Re-read mvw2‚Äôs comment again. Execute on it. üôåüèº Successful people make their own luck by not quitting and keep trying Luck is random though, OP is asking about a trend that goes beyond just pure chance.

Your sentiment about being successful and it having to do with luck is right, but there's more to it than just that here. Disagree that luck is relevant. Any decent idea will be copied quickly. You have to execute at speed over long time periods. No such thing as luck. Why do we call it luck!? Why we don't call it catching the right trend? That's what I'm talking about! Would you mind sharing what he does every day? That's why there are only a few ways to become rich as an introvert/less social.

I've rarely seen someone become financially successful without having a connection to the masses What about making the best trading algo if you are math genius? No one would hire me, so I had to start my own company. Now I‚Äôm your competitor bishes. My bitterness drives me. üëèüèªüëèüèªüíØ Adaptation is and will always be the way to keep pushing forward How do i get in on this game? Don't forget that developing such long-term friends not only takes time but you might not get caught in the right circle or at least not the right circle for what you want to become I think by networking, you increase your luck. I mean, really deep networking. Not going to events and spraying you cards. I mean being real long term friends with rich people. Nothing else matters that much. It's about being in tune with what people in a given market will buy.  That person tapped into the fact that flyaways are a problem for many and people would buy a product to remedy it.  A lot of successful people are good at identifying underserved markets. They are in touch with what people NEED, not just complex ideas.  The simplicity doesn't matter. They are focused on serving a need.

I find a lot of smart people have these very complex business ideas they made up in their head but don't really take time to identify if their concept is needed or understood by a broader market. They are wrapped up in the details that don't matter. Indeed, I'm still trying to acknowledge how messy people are which is translated to a messy world True, once I read an article that says that the ‚Äúregular‚Äù managers see the highly intelligent employees as a toxic threat to the working environment rather than a strong factor in improving the work quality. Hii check your DM bruh Yes, I'm speaking beyond entrepreneurship.

For example, you see a lot of intellectuals, scientists, and highly qualified academic personnel, yet they barely meet their basic stuff.

I've studied their spending habits, they're all not that bad, it's just their position does not make them that money in comparison to someone who might have 10% of their knowledge but successfully built a profitable business Kinda agree but you can't always have things in your favor, if so you're not necessarily less smarter Wonder how these 2 affect? This sounds like book smarts.

For me intelligence is critical thinking and fluid intelligence, being able to change your mind on something you were fairly sure about if new evidence presents itself (maybe that‚Äôs emotional intelligence)? Thinking with logic and deductive reasoning.

That‚Äôs real intelligence to me.

If you can solve problems, look at things with an open mind, have a high tolerance to risk and endure a lot of pain, constant knock backs and hardship then you can be very successful.

Sounds easy doesn‚Äôt it haha. I feel like there‚Äôs different kinds of over thinking. Some that works and some that doesn‚Äôt. 

For me, I love to overthink. For example. If I want to know what x+y equals 10. I‚Äôll try 1+2. 1+3. 1+4. 

And eventually I‚Äôll get to 10. Because good overthinking is just trial and error. 

But I‚Äôll know people who‚Äôll go ‚Äúbut 1+2 doesn‚Äôt equal 10. Why doesnt it equal 10?‚Äù

And they‚Äôll get into this circular logic where they just keep rehashing the same thing over and over again and call it overthinking. 

It frustrates me, because I think trial and error eventually gives results. But rumination is a terminal end. It‚Äôs OK to think a lot. But don‚Äôt double down on a dead end. ‚ù§Ô∏è üß† ‚õ∞Ô∏è üèî ‚õ∞Ô∏è Damn sounds like me. I consider myself book smart (3 college degrees including a masters, all in the sciences) but I have a hard time thinking outside the box and also poor on soft skills. 

Two skills that are definitely needed to be an entrepreneur. . I'm trying to work on it but will tske a while to rewire the brain True I think OP was referring to the academic types as well. 

Newton and Tesla changed the world. But as celibate geniuses who hated average folks, I am pretty sure they would have sucked at business. 

Different talents as you said. What about Elon? Basically me and it drove my poor hotel guy nuts lol. 

He kept wanting me to have confirmed travel plans. And I‚Äôm just doing it day by day lol. 

I just can‚Äôt help it. I hate sitting down and planning it. Run and gun is just more fun. And there‚Äôs some challenge to just making it work. It‚Äôs kinda like dancing. You only have to make it work in the moment and then there‚Äôs a new moment with a whole new rhythm. Do your best not to fall and it‚Äôs great Pros and cons to everything... Billionaires on an average go bankrupt multiple times in their life. 
Millionaire once or twice. 
Average earners... Never. This is great! 

A lot in common: taking blows, pain tolerance, discipline and showing up everyday. 

Until you become the coach... Then you can get fat and relax üòÇ (jk) I have ADHD myself. For the most part I've learned how to use it. The parameter I tell people to use is profit. You never want to over engineer to the point you lose money. 

It‚Äôs like building a product. You have to design it so the cost is lower than the sale price. Worst part about this is... There's literally just one advice that can work in this case... And it really is JUST DO IT. 
Can't help it. Depends on the person. Don't make generalisations. Haven't you heard about arrogant vs humble people ü´† You don't need to make big claims to conduct good marketing. Quality over quantity. Thank you for sticking to your morals and caring more about doing your best rather than what just makes more money. It's an ideology I share and I wish more people operated this way, regardless of what industry they are in. I humbly submit the most important thing is not becoming unhoused. You can get a therapist for bad feelings. I‚Äôm interested, what was so very wrong with drop shipping?

I‚Äôm not being defensive, just curious (and maybe na√Øve) Sorry for the noob question, but why is dropshipping seen as unethical? If you were feeling bad about dropping, it was probably because you were slinging junk. If you still represent a good product and find customers for which it is a good fit, you are just a lead generator / marketer. I hadn't heard about mutualism before, but now that I did I can understand what you are going though. I have a background in non-profits and education, sectors that primarily give instead of taking. I am building a consulting firm that aims in systemic change, acting as a catalyst for stakeholder capitalism Definitely more action. I have a friend that always sees herself as smart, but she has been publishing the same book for literally over 15 years. 

Meanwhile, I published and sold over 20 short books in the last two years on Amazon. Are they all perfect and best sellers? No but some of them are selling. 

It‚Äôs really about action and not overthinking. Yes you will make mistakes but the key is what you learned from them so you can do more action and have more success. What they don‚Äôt realize is that you actually need the mistakes and mistakes don‚Äôt make you dumb. They actually make you smarter. But they don‚Äôt see it that way. They always need structure and don‚Äôt take action. Right which makes you wonder if those people are actually that intelligent lol Or the fidget spinner guy. Or the jump to conclusions mat.¬† Oh for sure Which is precisely why some people, on paper, whether they be highly talented, intelligent or motivated simply don‚Äôt do well, whilst others with what OP perceives as fewer skills get incredibly lucky and do really well Of course there is. 

When you‚Äôre driving down the highway tomorrow you could be lucky and have no accident, or a deer could run into the road and send you into a ditch, and your steering wheel could crush your chest.

When you‚Äôre starting a new venture you could get a social post picked up and go viral, and see great success, or you could get smashed by the algorithm for months and months.

You could enter the market and capture significant market share, or another company could start up in the same niche as you with significant financial backing.

A huge amount of success in business is luck. It tends to be those who have been lucky that massively downplay the impact of luck on their own success. There‚Äôs a luck component to any success for sure. But what most people fail to realize is that they have to show up everyday for that luck to find them. If they‚Äôre only showing up for a few hours a week then luck is going to find someone else. That week off ‚Äúbecause I work hard and deserve this‚Äù was probably the week lady luck was knocking on the door and no one was there to answer. Because then you must ask yourself how are the so called talented people consistently missing the right trend? How is ""Being born to rich parents"" catching the right trend and not luck? They are external factors to which you have no control over Well how about just being born in a country that has infrastructure for you to succeed ? 

Success requires certain skills to achieve but luck also plays a role Luck is when preparation meets good opportunity. There's already a word for it, luck. You don't get by just with luck most of the time, but if you've done the work and you're ready for the luck you just need to grab hold. Consistently Knocks doors, he only works 2 weeks a month but takes the Solar blitz seriously Right. That's because we are a social species. And unless you have some special math, physics, or engineering skill...or luck...you're SOL. I don't play them games, just keep it real But that time has no cost. As a human, we are social animals and bound to make deep friendships. So, why not choose friends from your target industry? I'm not going to say I'm incredibly talented or intelligent, but I strive to be good/great at my day to day responsibilities. I also would go above and beyond at any job I've ever had. I would do my work along with continuing to educate myself in the field I was working. I took on responsibilities outside of my job description,to be a team player and help the team. I would put my heart into my roles and would be targeted over and over. I could tell you so many stories, but that is not the point. 

The point is that I have started to become accepting of the fact that I am a threat to the people that have employed me. I was not meant to succeed in those roles. As well as feeling that if my motivations and goals become minimal, I'd have better chances of being in my superior's favor. It is hard to always be the person that trains the new employees, is following the rules, exceeds expectations and inevitably becomes a target. 

To be considered good enough to train your replacement, but also a threat to the hierarchy, is exhausting. It has ultimately made me feel like laziness is rewarded, so why am I trying so hard. Watching people with less experience, less responsibility, less drive, and less knowledge, be promoted to career changing positions is heartbreaking. Not even necessarily a business either, though. For example I know PhDs struggling to maintain employment while teachers where I‚Äôm from with only 5 years of post secondary are making $100k a year. Some are happy, some aren‚Äôt. Hormones fuel drive and energy which are both essential for entrepreneurs. Having ADHD or autism probably helps. That is very true. And this person is not very open minded, very rigid thinking, and super risk-averse. So she remains stuck. But like you said very booksmart. Tolerances to resilience and pain doesn‚Äôt make you intelligent. I worked in a lot of startups and honestly the people who make it just don‚Äôt think too much about what could happen wrong.

Many intelligent people do not like taking risk. They also want to specialize in their field where to be entrepreneur you need to be fluid. 

I would say successful entrepreneurs are clever and optimistic. Many intelligent people have depression and are not optimist. It's the trial and error part that they often never get to. I'm an overthinker at times too but I do a lot of trial and error.  People who struggle never get to the trial part because the are obsessed with failure and potential errors.... and fear failure so much so they are stuck. I agree with the first sentence, but disagree with the main idea here. There is little to no value in wondering why 1 + 2 ‚â† 10.  And trial and error, while necessary for solving some unknown problems, is counter-productive when the answer is already known. 

So, yes, there is a kind of overthinking that does work. Probably many. One involves planning and trying to foresee all the potential pitfalls. Then determining which are more likely, and designing contingency plans for them. You might say, "" that's not overthinking"" but I would say it is, because you're not going to use all of those contingency plans, so it fits the description. Insane Nailed it. I think it‚Äôs awesome that you understand that. So many people think that book smarts is all they need, but they don‚Äôt realize that the analytical side can be turned on and wound a little too tight to be creative. Don‚Äôt be afraid to fail and just try. If you have to keep trying and failing, it‚Äôs the lessons that are going to be so worthwhile.

Have you ever listened to a lot of successful entrepreneur stories? A lot of them are high school dropouts or people that didn‚Äôt do well in school. They are creativity, driven and resilience is what carried them. 

They are also very in touch with what people want to buy.  I personally found school to be very limiting because I felt that it taught me one way to do something but entrepreneurship made me feel more creative and free. I guess our minds all work differently.

There‚Äôs pros and cons to thinking both ways for sure. Sometimes it would help me to go by the book more often but I like to hunt and pack until I figure things out. There‚Äôs the story that Newton invested in the South Seas company in the 1720s and got big gains early on after selling his stock. But the stock kept rising, so he rebought his shares out of FOMO. The bubble burst and he lost everything. Free dem boys No point commenting one single man in this world. This is how I think too. I make tons of mistakes but I also have a lot of success. That‚Äôs an interesting stat, do you have a source on it? Lol, same and I came to this sub looking for general advice to curb my current ruminating over every little ""what-if"". I don‚Äôt want to do that. I actually enjoy the thrill of the challenge that‚Äôs set, but I do fall into a rabbit hole and 6 hours later it feels like I‚Äôve only done 5 mins.  Missus hates that about me lol Unfortunately that‚Äôs not an option when you‚Äôre hyper focused.  You don‚Äôt realise that it‚Äôs taken you 6 hours to do something, you thought it was 5 or 10 minutes tops. LOL you all speak in boomer Facebook motivational quotes üòÇ There is enough money in business to do something that is positive/ethical or at the very least, not wrong. 

The streets aren‚Äôt lined with people sleeping round because their moral compass was too strong. You can't be successful in dropshipping without misleading your customers. Like you have to hide the fact that there is a long delivery time. You don't mention that if they want to return their item that they have to send it back to China which is really expensive. 

And there's a lot more examples like this. If you would be transparent in everything, like showing the delivery time, there won't be any reason for a customer to order your product. Publishing books on amazon is something I‚Äôve been interested in. Is there actually money to be made, as in equal to a regular salary? What‚Äôs her intention though?

Is it the carefully curate a book which means a great deal to her, or smash out 20 pamphlets on Amazon and make a few quid in the process? Yeah but what about the quality of the content you produced? Is society far better off because of the books you have written? What are you classing as intelligence?! Bizarre comment. 

I know some blokes who run highly successful businesses but they can‚Äôt string a sentence together.  Is that a lack of intelligence? No. 

Ingenuity is another form of intelligence. Seeing opportunities and grabbing them is a different form of intelligence. That‚Äôs just things. It either happens or not. Not working hard enough It was god's plan, so it can't be luck. /s Oh wow, okay! Thanks for the reply :) I highly doubt so. 

ADHD symptoms include shiny object syndrome, time blindness, object impermanence/forgetfulness, boredom, and executive functioning problems. 

ASD symptoms include miscommunication with neurotypicals (which makes sales difficult), trouble with improvisation/adaptability, and lower burnout threshold (which makes it hard to work 40 hour weeks, let alone 60+ hours that entrepreneurs do). ADHD doesn't help me stay on task :( Please explain why you think it helps? Probably self diagnosed by social media propoganda ADHD yes but why autism? I agree. The second part wasn‚Äôt saying that those things make you intelligent, just that those are the qualities required for success as an entrepreneur. In my opinion of course. The answer isn‚Äôt always known. Just because you know 1+9 equals 10 doesn‚Äôt mean someone knows the answer to their own specific question. 

10 was just an example. The question could be ‚Äúhow do you make profit,‚Äù and sometimes it‚Äôs just trial and error. 

I was saying the people who dwell on the wrong answers are the ones who do it wrong. Test a theory. If it doesn‚Äôt work. Move on. Don‚Äôt ruminate on bad math. Just move on. Eventually you hit the answer. And the faster and more efficient you are at cycling through data the faster you get the answer. Damn that's interesting... Didn't know this. Everything just takes more reps and practice I guess. was he using robinhood? He forgot what goes up must come down lol Oh you get to hyper focus too üòÅ You are the one with a username ""Hopeful_Industry"". But please I would be happy to hear your arguments why you generalised opinion is more concrete than my objective view That's not what the OP is talking about though Because you can only dropship dogshit from china? It's a romance novel. And yes, careful is an understatement at this point.

But she's like that with every single life decision....even choosing a restaurant on vacay is exhausting. She asks the waiter about 20 items to make sure he recommends them. Every single decision takes serious mulling over.

I'm trying to help her with her business I helped her launch in 2016.  The goal was to launch a product.  Nine years later she's still ""getting close.""  She is paralyzed with fear and is always afraid of what might happen.

So I used the book as an example, but it's waaaaaaay more examples than that.  It's everything in life. I have seriously never seen anyone stuck and indecisive like she is. They are coloring books for people with illnesses and affirmation journals.  Lots of good reviews so I guess someone likes 'em.

No, they aren't masterpieces, but they sell. I found an audience who wants that kind of stuff and created products.  I took action.  She has trouble with that out of fear it will fail.

Nothing wrong with taking pride in your work and taking your time, but there's a line.

I get your point, but the main point I was making is she never takes action due to indecision.  The book was one example, but she is like that in every aspect of life.  Deciding what to order on a menu paralyzes her. Every decision is like that. I feel for her.  Seems she lives in her head way too much and can't just enjoy the moment.

I realize my book comparison kinda made me seem a bit cocky and judgy.  Probably not a good example, but I was trying to emphasize the indecision. My bad. I feel like you‚Äôre describing me. I hate talking to people and probably most people don‚Äôt see me as intelligent at all. I‚Äôm very silly and goofy. But I definitely know how to make money. Lol. I know extremely successful company started by a really charismatic guy who couldn‚Äôt read and a really smart introverted guy. Both were smart in their own way and couldn‚Äôt make business work in  their own. And whether or not it does is largely down to luck. Of course, there are bad drivers who cause their own accidents, but the family that is in the other car are just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

The same is true in business - there have been excellent ideas with great execution that flop purely because of bad timing or other outside factors they couldn‚Äôt possibly have predicted.

Being successful in business is absolutely a combination of hard work, excellent execution, and luck. Missing any of the three you‚Äôre likely to fail. High functioning autistic people often have very good problem solving skills.

Edited - removed unverified claim. I struggle with this a lot. I'll hear somebody say ""just do x and you'll make money"" so I'll do x, remain broke, and wonder if it's my execution that was flawed, if it's the circumstances that's at failt, or if it's actually x that's flawed.  Add on the very real costs of failure (time, money, and patience) and it becomes unsustainable. It‚Äôs a fun story to read. Still, he died rich because of his other investments and his role as Master of the Royal Mint. Tesla, not so much: https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsnr.2018.0018 Best part of the condition in my opinion Ahhh‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs painful. 
We‚Äôre definitely on the other end of the scale and 100% accept your point. 

My commiserations. Some of the best restaurants are those that you stumble into by sheer chance. Thank you for kindly clarifying! Curious to know what discussions you have had with her around those situations? Maybe you could co-author a book about analysis paralysis together and share real experiences of hers I failed in school and didn‚Äôt go to uni. Didn‚Äôt really get a proper job until I was 30. Now I run a big digital agency. Charisma and confidence gets you VERY far! Show me any evidence that people with autism are better at running a business or being entrepreneurs. Most adults with autism are unemployed. 
Please stop spreading myths wasn‚Äôt that the prevalence of clinical psychopathy among ceos? One of the biggest life lessons I've learned over time is that it's important to recognize one's own specific flaws and failings. And then try and find solutions for those. Sometimes it's a multi-step process.

For a personal example. One of my biggest flaws is that I loathe planning. I hate scheduling things. I like to wake up randomly in the morning between 10 and 12, and then kinda bumble through my day. If I ever set a schedule I feel 'caged,' and i don't like it.

So knowing this flaw of mine. It's hard when I read advice from people that say ""Get a planner, and block off an hour for this and an hour for that.""

I have to be aware of my own flaws, so that I can recognize that advice tailored to people who aren't flawed isn't going to be useful to me. And it means that advice I need has to be specific for my way of doing things. 

That or I 'learn how to change.' But change isn't always easy. I've tried dozens of organization apps and time blocking, and it just feels like prison. I hate them. I hate them so much. I just want to fly around and live life based on how I feel.

\----------------------------

But also because of this group. Here's how I worked my reckless behavior into my business. I run a small bakery that primarily focuses on wedding and specialty cakes. 

A lot of my competition needs time and planning to do things. But if I had a client that came to me at 8am, and they say they need a wedding cake at 2pm (here's a lot of money). I'll say sure, I can wing that! And then I just do it. Easy money. 

Because I don't like planning, I also don't need a build up to be productive. I'm incredibly adaptive, but struggle to commit to plans. 

===

Anyways, I got rambly. But the point is, know how your behavior shapes you, and always be aware of that when you take advice or try something new. 

And for me, it's not an over-analysis. I hate schedules, because it makes me feel less free. There's not much depth to that. And if there is, I never cared enough to explore the psychological nature of it. But I'm comfortable winging things, so I seek out advice that's shaped for someone with my personal type. 

Not every shoe fits everyone, but there's typically always a shoe for each specific need. Just gotta figure out your size and then find the shoe! Yep for me I can hyperfocus by finding something that I like about the topic. Exactly! I've had to learn not to travel with her because I like to explore. She wants to go to the same exact restaurants when we visit a city we like. I think that would be great.  What's interesting about her is she doesn't seem to feel comfortable acknowledging this is her problem.  I've touched on the subject lightly and she moved away from the discussion quickly.  Some people are not comfortable being vulnerable about what they struggle with and she always gives another reason or excuse for why she hesitates.  So I just leave it alone.

But to be honest, admitting it would probably be the first step.  But not everyone is ready and that's OK. hey, do you have any vacancies open at the moment? am looking for a stable job at the moment lol Love it! Cheers to you! I was referring to high functioning autism.

I can‚Äôt find the article I was referring to so I‚Äôll edit that part if it makes you happy. How about YOU stop spreading myths lol bc This is a very uneducated comment. Lots of autistic adults are able to work. Lots of autistic adults actually have a certain talent or ‚Äúspecial interest‚Äù that allows them to excel in that area more than an average person. Severe autism, yes they might be unemployed or need extra help. But, autism is a scale and those who are autistic might share certain traits, but be able to function differently than each other. Are you in a relationship? Just curious lol I don‚Äôt even need to like the topic, I like the challenge and that‚Äôs what does it for me.  I don‚Äôt plan to fall down the rabbit hole, it just happens There are two types of people in the world; those that appreciate that variety is the spice of life, and people who are wrong. Sounds very reasonable! Haha yes but you won‚Äôt be local. That‚Äôs not a myth, [up to 85% of autistic adults are unemployed.](https://www.goldenstepsaba.com/resources/autism-unemployment-rate)

But you can provide a counter statistic if you have one. Also autism and high functioning autism are two different things and I didn‚Äôt make any statements about the latter.

[More info here ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_of_autistic_people#Statistics)

[Even more info here](https://www.autistica.org.uk/news/autistic-people-highest-unemployment-rates) Yeah I‚Äôve been married for a few years now. My wife hates making big decisions so she always likes me to work through the choices. She just sits back and enjoys the ride! I've got to get some sleep You know how fun that is for us Worst time of the day.  Feel like I‚Äôm being un-productive lol",2025-01-18 06:37:26

Rabbit ",,saturated,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i42prn/do_you_wish_you_couldve_capitalized_on_the_dot/,Do you wish you could‚Äôve capitalized on the dot com era?,I wish i couldve but i wasnt even born to be able to even have a chance in that time and i know everyone is like ‚Äúai is going to be like the dot com era‚Äù and to that i say there will probably be 3 big companies that control that whole market cause i dont think there will be much innovation till we can add it to robots or like human robots. Like chatgpt and the other big ones dont really give any up to date info or any info that is very in depth and if you ask it for deeper explanations it just repeats itself with a longer paragraph and sometimes the arent even accurate ,"This is what the dot Com era was like. Everyone saying it's the next big thing with many people doubting it and saying it wo uld just be kids in chat rooms. In those days it was creativity that was needed to envision making money with the web. You'd hear about others and realize they had a great idea, so simple why didn't I think of it? You'll probably go through the same with ai and robots. I was a child when the dot com bubble burst. And then at 2007 I started in Tech, just when people started to talk about agile for the first time and when companies started to digitalization. It was golden age of software development that carried out all the way over pandemic. But then the big investment funds pulled off a lot of tech funding which led to mass layoffs of developers for the first time ever. And it‚Äôs not getting any better, I follow up on this every quarter and it‚Äôs still happening.

AI was pretty ridiculous in 2024, it seems to have slowed down a bit. But in 2024 wr saw the most ridiculous AI start ups ever that got hundreds of millions in funding. Remember Rabbit R1 ? That was absolutely hilarious. Or the super recent one; the AI pin thing? Who‚Äôs funding this stuff? :D 

And what about those hundreds of small ones that just integrated to ChatGPT and said they have AI? They managed to fool a lot of investors. 

The thing is that if you have shit loads of money and you can afford to invest long term without returns, AI might be your thing: but AI start ups have yet to make any money, any profits. OpenAI operates in massive massive loss, they will turn profitable and become very commercialized in few years but as of yet, they lose shit tons of money. And same for all ai start ups: so while it might SEEM like dot com bubble, it‚Äôs not. With dot com you could have made quick profits and money, with AI not at all. Not yet at least. it was a huge missed opportunity for a lot of people. AI‚Äôs still growing though, so who knows where it‚Äôll be in 10 years. I was around in the ""Dot Com"" era. But not really an entrepreneur then. And I kept asking people ""yeah, but how is it going to make money"" and their answers never made any sense to me.

So no, I would not have wanted to be a part of it, because most of them were scams, and I would rather build a business that helps people live better. So it this how you think? You keep regretting what you didn't do instead of looking at where you are at now and capitalizing at opportunities in the present?

Back then you come up with excuses to not work and right now you are doing the same. Some people wired to make up excuses and some are wired to come up with possibilities.

You are the first. Accept it and live your life. Whenever you read about it in hindsight, it sounds like such an exciting time.

But was it as exciting as the the times we are in now? Not a chance! Oooh, that was a good time. But you had to see it for what it was. I was one of two partners in a company that built out data centers. Raised floor, Liebert AC's and UPS's, generators and such. Tremendous time of growth, but also an insight into the stupidity of trends as we were building for companies that were worth $30m or more that had no employees, no furniture, no phone lines. When it all came crashing down we took a break for a few weeks, then relaunched as a company specializing in removal of data centers, and had our own boom on the [dot.com](http://dot.com) bomb. I saw it in real life, as a sham. 

AI is going to be useful for a lot of things, but people are trying to automate things that will not take. Yea thats valid the ideas are simple now that we know what they are. But now you cant make or think of a business idea now without researching and finding out there 100 other businesses already doing that like everything is just so over saturated now no matter what it is Hey there I have two business ideas and id want to hear someones opinion can I send you a message Hey there I have two business ideas and id want to hear someones opinion can I send you a message Yea exactly literally anything ai just throw 10 million in funding like its a crazy time where you can make something that basically does nothing different or innovative and still be considered a business During the dot com era companies were also running at a loss though.

One mentor of mine did over 50 tests a week across all departments. His business did $300M last year. He started it 7 years ago. When I asked him how to get an outcome or if a business idea was good, he said: ""Just test it.""

After adopting this mindset and testing more, I stabilized my business, began seeing real growth, and started feeling in control‚Äîno more guessing what worked.

Talking to my friends with smaller bus","good, growth",,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i3st7p/your_business_will_probably_fail_keep_reading_if/,Your business will probably fail. Keep reading if you don't want to be statistic.,"**Business is simple. Not easy.**  
If you own a business, you are likely to fail. 9 out of 10 businesses fail, and you probably don‚Äôt want to be one of them.

As a young entrepreneur, I‚Äôve made it a point to meet successful business owners in my state‚Äîranging from those doing $300k/year to $5B/year. The differences in their businesses were vast, from local services to corporate conglomerates. But there was¬†**one thing**¬†they all had in common.

The ones making the¬†**least**¬†money often thought they had it all figured out. They were anxious, yes, but they had a mindset of ""I already know what works and what doesn‚Äôt."" They believed their business was ""great"" on the first try. There was just something wrong with the market. As a result, they faced many down seasons, and some are out of business now.

On the other hand, the ones who made the¬†**most**¬†money assumed they knew nothing. They respected the market, knew there were multiple ways to solve a problem, and were always listening to their customers. They didn‚Äôt assume they knew the answers‚Äîthey tested everything. They were data-driven.

After many meetings with these mentors, I started asking:¬†**How often do you split test?**  
The ones who made the least money did the least split testing. The ones who made the most did the most split testing. In fact, the most successful ones were running dozens of tests across all areas of their business.

One mentor of mine did over 50 tests a week across all departments. His business did $300M last year. He started it 7 years ago. When I asked him how to get an outcome or if a business idea was good, he said: ""Just test it.""

After adopting this mindset and testing more, I stabilized my business, began seeing real growth, and started feeling in control‚Äîno more guessing what worked.

Talking to my friends with smaller businesses felt like they were gambling in a casino, while experienced entrepreneurs operated with the confidence of mastering a control panel‚Äîflipping switches knowing the outcome.

Testing is crucial because it gives you real feedback. Want to know your business idea is any good? Test it. Want to change your price? Test it. Want to improve your marketing? Test different variables and see the results. In just days, you‚Äôll have clear answers (quickly and cheaply) instead of relying on guesswork.","Testing, can‚Äôt wait to make billions‚Ä¶

Testing is important but plenty of companies test changes and fail.

Testing is one piece of a very large puzzle that makes a business successful I agree split testing is good. But most startups are facing the issue of lack of users/engagement. It's hard to split test for valuable feedback when you have nobody... Or not enough.. users to test against to get valuable data.

My app has 100,000 users. With 10k accessing it daily. It's easy for me to spin up a new icon, screenshots, etc and split test conversion ratings. But I'm already successful, so I'm just optimizing for further growth. When the app first released this type of testing was practically impossible to get any meaningful data against.

So with that said, I think it should be mentioned that ""throwing shit against the wall to see what sticks"" is a valuable testing method for early startups, and that eventually merges into split testing when the data you can get becomes more valuable. 

Just my two cents. Not sure why this is downvoted sounds like good advice I think this is a very insightful post. However, I would add that it‚Äôs important to decide on what to test. Testing ideally should be something where you really don‚Äôt know the answer, so it‚Äôs 50/50 as to what result will be (makes best use of your test time), something that is conclusive (statistically significant), and has a high impact on your business performance (the answer will substantially change your business model). I have learnt a lot from you today This is a great post. I don't understand why people downvote it.  
I don't see any shady self-promotion.

Testing is a reality check. I believe many people have an intuition/idea and think they are smart and that the idea is very valuable and become enthusiastic about starting production.

It seems like our society believes that a good idea is all you need to build a successful business.  
People don't like criticism, nevertheless putting the own idea to a critical test.

I love the book ""The lean start-up"" from Eric Reis. It emphasises not only being humble and recognising that 9 out of 10 of your ideas may fail, but based on that promotes building an environment to quickly and efficiently test through different ideas and validate them. Good stuff. The difference between winners and losers is how fast and often they try new things properly, eventually something works but they execute at a higher quality and speed than others. Testing with retrospection and having a good understanding of the well-associated risks is equally as important. Look for example at disastrous sonos app launch. While this is good advice, I don't appreciate being attacked.

So I say, ""No u"" My mantra has always been fail fast and fail cheap. No need to spent all of your life savings into your MVP. MINIMUM viable product, it's in the name. If you're building an airplane, start gutting it until it only proves that it can take off, cruise and land (metaphorically speaking) Wow, thanks for going through the effort in writing this post. You put a lot of thought into it and it‚Äôs incredibly refreshing to read something that‚Äôs brilliant and not AI generated. 

And i really took this advice at heart and it did make me think a lot that I could do differently Agreed. But then test marketing channels, value propositions.

Throwing things against the wall is absolutely testing, and not everything has to be metric based. I like the way you think man. Then test marketing, find out what works by trying a bunch of things in marketing. It's downvoted because he's trying to sell something. Super hard to figure out what to test. Especially when you reach scale. The lean start up is great. Testing is hard because it requires humility and the willingness to admit ‚Äúthe first way I did this may suck‚Äù. Bias to action and high agency is everything A guiding principle of Amazon. Absolutely Love this analogy! |I didn't see that what is high agency? Oh yeah! The term retrospection itself is one that I always use in all of the projects that I work with. It's very important to see the bigger picture each step of the way -- because its very easy to get carried away with trying to achieve a series of tasks that you \*think\* will get you to the destination, but actually don't.

Saving Homeowners  from expensive Hot Water Heater Rental charges,"I need some feedback and advice if this might be a viable business plan. 

In my province and area; All new subdivision houses are put on rental hot water tanks. The monthly rates are quite ridiculous, upwards of $30 to $40 bucks a month. Within a few years, they could have already paid off a water heater of their own. 

Most residents aren‚Äôt aware that you can get out of the rental by installing your own hot water tank and dropping off the existing tank with the rental company - they don‚Äôt tell you this, they say you need to buy it out but you can outright refuse and just send it back the closest warehouse or they will pick it up for you for $100.

Any tips on making this work or do you think it could be viable for someone like me without the installation skills and just work the sales? 
","This sounds like a pretty smart idea! I think a lot of people aren‚Äôt aware of options beyond renting, mostly because it‚Äôs just easier to keep the status quo and not everyone has time to research. People might not realize how much they're overpaying over time. I think there could be a big market for someone who can break this all down and make it simple to switch. 

Since you‚Äôre not planning to do installations yourself, you could partner up with reputable local plumbers or plumbing companies. That way, you handle the sales and the homeowner relationships while the professionals handle the install. You could even work out a referral deal with them where you get a cut every time you bring them a customer. 

Also, educating first is key, maybe putting together a simple online guide or flyer that explains how rental fees work versus owning‚Äîit might even become a key resource people start sharing. Maybe even offer to help with the paperwork or logistics of returning the rental heater‚Äîthat part seems annoyingly tedious, and if you take care of it, it could be a big selling point for your service. You want to make this as hassle-free as possible for them.

Design a clear, straightforward website or flyers and consider targeting community Facebook pages or forums where homeowners in your area hang out. Word of mouth will be huge too. Start with friends, family, or neighbors who trust you and build from there. You might have something good going on! Appreciate the great insight and your post describes exactly what has been going through my head. I totally agree that education is the key here and a concise breakdown of the costs in a flyer or guide format is essential. I would like to make this as easy as possible for the homeowner so as you mentioned, taking care of the paperwork and logistics of returning the hot water heaters would  be something that I would do for them to provide a seamless and painless experience for them. 

Thanks for the advice! Thanks LLM¬†",2025-01-17 16:16:39

I‚Äôve been in that analysis paralysis mode too. You're not alone there. Sometimes being good at a lot of things can make it tough to pick just one path. If you're leaning towards tech and AI without heavy coding, maybe look into no-code or low-code platforms. They let you build cool stuff without needing hardcore programming skills.

Web development is a pretty solid area too. Maybe focusing on something niche within tech could be a way to go‚Äîlike developing tools that help other small businesses or freelancers run their operations more smoothly. It doesn't always have to be about being the next big startup. Sometimes the smaller, practical ideas have a lot of legs, especially if you see something that other people in your space are missing.

Also, you seem to enjoy studying taxes. That's kinda rare, and believe it or not, there might be a market for tech solutions that simplify taxes for young entrepreneurs and freelancers, especially as new digital economies keep evolving. Maybe an app that simplifies tax codes for creatives and non-finance folks?

The ‚Äújob‚Äù as the family baby was sarcasm and the ‚Äúlay off‚Äù was meant for being displaced as the family baby for someone new (his baby sister) and now we are saving for her. We say they earned more than we ever did as we aren‚Äôt from money but now we make it and we can do that. All in all if at 22 with 100K is a great then he is doing well and on the right path. I for sure didn‚Äôt have that. I read it & think ""he works hard for his little money""

I suggest ""don't work for your money, let money work firbyou""

as the OP you should get your money to work for you

your already well invested except in speculative investments (trading markets)

that's your easiest first target for effort (minimum responsibilities & obstacles ...""just you Vs the market"")

then you can create a business with sustainable income (maximum responsibilities & obstacles ...""you Vs alot of obstacle from right product, right business, right industry, right  customers, right level of dependencies to be successful"") Not wrong, skool by Alex hermozi made it easier than ever starting a community and throwing a bunch of courses together. but a lot of markets with high saturation typically have high margins/worth doing. With courses, it's more so about the creator rather than the courses at face value. People typically buy the course/digital product because they believe in the creator.
You're buying the creator, not the product.
When the creator is pitching, their also selling themselves.

The ones just selling courses are not doing as well as the creators with audiences indulging relations. [deleted] Amen! What were you doing for work to be able to save 100k in three years? I imagine you also sent allot of money back home if your family weren't doing so good? High yield savings that have limits on how much you can withdraw will pay 3.5-4.5% depending on how much you out down.

3.5k per month is enough travel on at 22. You sound knowledgeable for your age, however, you are nearing the ‚Äúmaster of none‚Äù issue I experienced in my 20‚Äôs. 

Also, be very wary of people who claim to want to spend their time teaching you how to be more successful. This is usually because they lack the ability to actually succeed in their field, and thus reach down into the pockets of those below them to fund their future and current endeavors. 

Real answers usually come from people who are seemingly the least successful. 

Anyways, back to my main point. Looking back on my 20‚Äôs, if I just focused on one thing, instead of being fascinated by many things, and indulging in multiple of them at once, I‚Äôd likely be better off. 

I‚Äôm still very successful going into my 30‚Äôs, but, I could be further if I locked in earlier. 

Don‚Äôt waste these years. Get really good at one thing, and then use that tool as your wedge to meet highly productive people. 

As you get older, you‚Äôll realize it‚Äôs not really about what you do, it‚Äôs about how good you do it, and who you know. 

When you start meeting the people who you really want to know by being really good at one thing, you‚Äôll notice that they all know each other. 

Why? Because most people need the same things, or know people who do, and there‚Äôs only a few people who do those things really well. This may be hard to understand, but I really wish I knew it earlier. I'm not gatekeeping, just the honest answer. I'm not going to be able to bring  over 100k links on a platter, sir. Real life is not simple. Education is not simple.
Things that are worth doing require effort. Most things I've done failed.
I learn mostly from failures as they require me to get through the complete process of building something that contributes to my understanding of the building infrastructure. I've done option trading, amazon FBA, dropshipping, and worst of all, 2 day jobs.
I did send my family money at that time until I went back and brought them back to the us. yeah, and on 100k deposit, 3.5% is $3500 per year, or a little under 300/month. You can't live off of that. this is soooo true...good post !

I might have to skip on Elevenlabs and the editing, because I need to crank out at least 20 videos per day. 

It seems like a lot but I focus on 12 hours a day and 3 videos per hour. 12 hours times 3 videos= 36 videos per day. But I only need 20 videos in the 12 hours, so I know I can meet my quota for the day. 

I'm looking at 20 videos per day times roughly 30 days is 600 videos per month. My goal is to finish the year with at least $100,000 in ""CASH"" after taxes, paying rent, buying food and having all my bills paid.

So, I need to make $273.97 per day times 365 days= $100,000. The most I've made was off 1 video with only 600 views and I made over $3,300. 

I wasn't even monetized by Youtube. I made all that money from software commissions alone. I don't care about being monetized by Youtube what so ever.

With Youtube monetized payouts you need millions of views to make money, with software commissions ranging from 20%- 40% I don't need Youtube revenue.

It's really simple. Go sign up at an affiliate network and once you get your affiliate links start promoting. That's simple.

Not really understanding your thought process here because people can already duplicate your process if the content is on the internet. Yes, the content is on Youtube. However, the people watching my videos aren't looking to duplicate my process. They're looking for software reviews.

If I were in my videos saying how much money I made then people would be interested in duplicating my process. 

That's what got me started. This guy I was following would show inside his affiliate accounts, showing how much, he made on each affiliate network, and I could see the products he was promoting.

I hold an event each September to kick off the new season of my app FrightMaps.  It's a ticketed event at a local farm and usually 2-300 people come. I have food trucks / vendors and a movie in the field. 

My Idea:   
Is it worth to get 2 small pizza ovens ( the personal use ones ) and 2 rolled ice cream machines to serve here? 

The idea if plausible would be to at least break even for the equipment and supplies. 

I would need some food certs though, right?

I know people have mixed reviews of rolled ice cream, but I live in a college town thats pretty upscale.  I either wanted to turn that equipment into a side hustle where I bring it to other events, AND OR open up a small ice cream shop with the rolled ice cream machines.

All the best! Man you‚Äôre good with social media, software dev and sport. You have already succeeded. Just be patient and keep building. I feel you, Im in the same boat [removed] Just start learning stuff and building it out online. 

The best thing you can do is connect with others and share your story. Experiment with your ideas and see what works for you. Don't prejudge something if you have not tried or experienced it. If there are certain challenges, there could be opportunities and solutions too which you might not have explored. Rather than looking at it as you haven't made ground, think of all you have learned while trying all of these things. Every time you learn something doesn't work, you are one step closer to finding something that does. It really is about consistency. I have played college baseball, worked as a stand up comedian and produced a 40 million dollar television show out of 30 rock and it always boiled down to just taking one small step after another and not getting beat down by something not working. Talk to you like you know nothing?

You don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to just start and keep going without over analyzing. I get the frustration ‚Äì it's tough to stay motivated when everything feels overwhelming. Just take one step at a time, even if it‚Äôs small, and keep learning as you go ‚Äì consistency is key. You haven't started yet so there's nothing to give up hehe. Just get on with it and test out your idea. Then go from there. I've been there and many others before me too.
Fear of change is often the cause of doubt when launching a project.
And if it doesn't work...
But how do you know if you don't try?
Some ideas take time to get started and to be profitable and you should not hesitate, in my opinion, to launch your project or study it further if necessary.
If it doesn't work as expected, at least you tried. 
If you don't try, you might live with regret.
It can be difficult at the beginning so take the time to think about it but if your project is really important to you, then don't doubt it anymore, tell yourself that we learn from our mistakes and that they allow us to move forward.

Advice if you're starting out: protect yourself financially with a side job at suitable hours in order to launch your project because initially, it's you who will finance it. In the best case, your project will allow you to be autonomous, otherwise, you will have learned from your experience and this will benefit you in one way or another.

Courage to you and weigh the pros and cons carefully. 
This decision is up to you. Yo bro listen I've been through this and i really feel you but you have understand two important things

1. Nothing is easy, we all struggle and we all face bad times and desperation but when you really understand that success comes from the bottom of suffering trust me you will never back off in your entire life 

2. Not every video on tiktok or youtube is real. Don't believe any of the shit that goes with ""I built my own business in a week""  ""I made 6 figures in a month"" 
""Making money is stupid easy"" Fuck no it can be easy but not that much and most of gurus you see starting from 0 to show you that it's so easy yeah it's easy cause they're already famous and have their reputation so all they do is just selling false hope and motivation. 

Invest in yourself, keep learning and keep going no matter how many times you fail, you will eventually reach to the top and for me I have no doubt that you will do it one day. Just don't throw it away, your ideas are still valuable to some extent. Next time you make a product, keep it and use your social media to market it. Seems you mentioned you have the skills to do so, just start! It's just about doing it and as counter intuitive it sounds you need to create an echo chamber around you. The business stuff is hard and very much against our biological perogative because most of us have a comfortable life. Hey man 
I think it would be great for us to connect 

I can't give you bussiness advice but I can provide you with tailored daily strategies for improving your mood by inducing drive + focus phisiologically based on medicine and physiological comprehensions

At the same time, I am also going through the hustle of creating a new bussiness since I desire to switch from presential practice to online practice.
Therefore in all likelyhood we are going through similar pains 

Answer my DM if you are interested in dialogue Before you throw away an idea, make sure you‚Äôve conducted proper market research and validated conclusively that it‚Äôs a bad idea and not just a gut feeling based on frustration. When engaging with potential customers or clients in the sector you‚Äôre conceptualising, you may find this process sparks a pivot into a new area you may not have anticipated just from talking to potential leads. Printing out a ‚Äòbusiness model canvas‚Äô and filling in the gaps will help you piece things together and allow room to begin strategising further. 

If you struggle with the execution, consider finding a co-founder to help support you or pitching your idea to an accelerator program who can help mentor you or even provide resources. If you do look at accelerator programs (like Y Combinator, Tech Stars etc) make sure you understand their terms and know that they take a considerable amount of equity which may not necessarily be positive in alot of cases. The true feedback you need is from the market when you are live. Just make sure the weaknesses you spot in your ideas are true weaknesses and not reasons to procrastinate and not begin I feel this. I‚Äôm in the same boat currently. I know people less qualified in my field are killing it more than I am because I‚Äôm too in my head and in my own way. I think the hardest part for me is the getting off the ground stage because at first it feels like nothing is working and not really sure if it‚Äôs ever going to pay off‚Ä¶but I like to think eventually it will and that everyone has to start somewhere. You gave the best answer yourself: ""not executing on my ideas forever will not get me anywhere."" Because it isn‚Äôt about the idea but about persevering to put it into practice. 

So, if you run out and pick up some of the ideas you threw out of the window and look at them again, can you see a clear customer value in at least one of them? 

Like, this X helps Y achieve Z.

Next question: what would it be worth for Y to achieve Z?

Finally, among 8 billion people worldwide, how many Y are out there who might buy your X to get the Z they desire?

The rest is about building a delivery system for your Xes, and that depends on what they are. I'm in the same boat as you. Too hesitant to start. Depressed all the time because I'm working for someone else with no energy in life. I'm not doing anything to better my life. It sucks. So much potential is being wasted. Life really feels like shit. Even I'm looking for advice, but I can't even post anything due to less karma. I'm a big fan of Alex aswell, his story is great and gives really practical advice of getting going.

One big thing I have taken away is he says pretty much any business can get you to a million a year, and I think he is right, so to the OP just get on with the best opportunity you have and stop getting distracted by other shiny opportunities as there are issue with every business and business model. Thank you. Is the advice he is giving in his videos any good for you? I badly need some sort of direction to take because what i an doing now feels way too bad. Thank you, i love the analogy. Described it really well. What do you mean I am writing everything i do/learn into a book on a daily basis. I plan to keep this going until the end of time, haha. I am struggling to actually get started.

This is essentially the next goal i have: i want to make only ONE customers' lives easier.
I dont even know how to make a customers life better. I dont have any ideas that i think are worth pursuing. But thay may just be because i am too harsh in evaluating whether an idea is good or bad. So basically, i just pick an idea and just go out there and test it? Reading all these comments has helped me significantly! I am currently making a huge list with businesses, which i am going to contact on Monday. Hey man, you are saying yourself that you need to change something.

Just do it. Just doing something is not that hard After 14 years in business and only coming across his stuff in the past year, the advice is some of the best business advice I've ever received.

I think right now you're in the valley of dispair as he puts it. It'll be really tempting to switch. If you've got a decent product/you still want ths to work, just be patient. Start selling your idea. Have to remember a business is just a transaction at the most simplest level. You don't have to over complicate and over engineer it. Just have to convince someone to agree to the transaction Maybe someone else will explain. I don‚Äôt know how much more I can simplify the response to your own question I had assumed you already had an idea. Well i guess you are right. I dont know what its like to start and keep going without overanalysing.

How do i achieve that? Is the idea the problem or is it just me. Do i just do it? I have many ideas. Its hard to pick one and just start You‚Äôre doing it now. You‚Äôre already asking too many questions. If you ever wonder why really dumb people are ahead of decent companies and the smart ones aren‚Äôt it‚Äôs because although the really smart people have better ways of doing things, nothing beats ACTUALLY doing! 

I was on a thread like this talking about analysis paralysis. 

Ill give you the same advice someone gave me. You‚Äôre not over analyzing, you‚Äôre just scared or lazy. Just go do it. The data will be there while you‚Äôre do it. 

Time will go on any way you slice. You‚Äôre the one choosing to stand still You know what you need to do, yet you‚Äôre still questioning whether you should. Thank you so much. 
This is the most helpful piece of text that i have ever been allowed to read.

You exactly hit the nail on the the head - thank you. I know that i have to get started. Thank you. You wrote one of the most inspiring sentences i have ever heard.

But what do i start? I think i only found out if something was worth starting if i really did start, right?",2025-01-17 07:11:08

So, what's the compromise? Who works for the money, anyway? Aren't most people in it for the team building and the cause? (Goes to burn journalism diploma but recalls she did that 10 years ago.) Ab","great, valuable",issue,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i38fps/whats_the_fastest_way_to_kill_team_morale_in_a/,What‚Äôs the fastest way to kill team morale in a startup (so we can avoid it)?,"Startups can be crazy, and keeping your team happy is everything. What are the things that kill motivation fast? Bad communication, micromanaging, unclear goals‚Äîlet‚Äôs talk about what to watch out for and how to fix it. Got any stories share or tips?","1. Micromanaging. 2. Giving promotions, raises, benefits etc to employees who TAKE the credit for others work (directors, executives should have one on ones with EVERY EMPLOYEE and be available and ethical).  A failure at the ‚Äútop‚Äù will ruin morale. Egos, lack of emotional intelligence, boundaries, over the top work hard play hard attitude, defined expectations, money Hiring experts and then not listening to anything they say. Having a narcissist for a boss. Lack of boundaries, unreasonable requests at unreasonable hours, gaslighting, over spending‚Ä¶well, embezzling, gobbling pills and sucking down booze, developing their flying monkeys while projecting everything negative they‚Äôre doing onto the team. Fun stuff! Creating an ""in group"" and an ""out group."" ¬†Your out group is going to feel excluded, work on their own work, lose the big picture, and spend the time mostly thinking about how early they can leave.

So involve as many people as possible in the decisions about the destiny of the business. ¬†Keep everyone involved in sales, in growth discussions, in how to take load off support.

It's inevitable that you will end up with an in-group who will be your managers, directors, and executives, but you want to delay that as long as possible. Psychopaths # Toxic Leadership

* **Symptoms**: Ego-driven decisions, lack of empathy, or a blame culture. That is a bad example also.
* **Fix**: Foster a culture of openness, humility, and accountability at the leadership level. An environment that is not a problem to recognize mistakes and truly learn from them. My last startup was a ground-up first principles type place which I appreciated on many fronts (deep work blocks, transparent calendars, remote first, unlimited PTO). But one that fell apart was pay parity. I.e. We‚Äôll pay everyone the same amount for the same role. They also offered higher than market salaries in exchange for no bonuses. 

But the parity sounds great right? Saves on individual negotiation, books are clean, no one-off raises and awkward salary talk. 

Except it all goes to hell when there‚Äôs a labor shortage and you have to drop standards to hire enough people to meet your growth targets. All of a sudden you have highly experienced people getting pay parity with recent college grads. Guess who walks out the door to go find a better salary, but not before poisoning the well with toxicity and resentment. Laying off good employees who have made key contributions for financial reasons while executives continue to make high salaries or get raises. Trying to hide things, people are already on edge about the health of the company so they‚Äôre extra sensitive to dishonesty.

If the company isn‚Äôt performing well, or some hard decisions are coming up then the more upfront you can be the more they‚Äôll trust you when you tell them to help weather the storm.

They want it to succeed too, nobody wants to feel like a commodity in a startup otherwise they would have just worked for a bigger slower company with a pension, etc. Hiring the wrong people. There are so many ways to achieve this. You‚Äôv pointed out a few possibilities yourself.
The most effective thing you can do to minimize ‚Äúkilling team morale‚Äù, is to define and drive a team work culture to proactively try to minimize this issue from happening. Skipping transparency during funding gaps breeds mistrust. If payroll is tight, be upfront. People will rally if they feel like partners, not just replaceable cogs Are you in one of those classic ""ass tattoo"" incentive situations? 

But anyway, I think the most critical thing is making people feel properly rewarded, so the balance between effort and reward must be healthy for the employee. Benchmark often to understand salaries, benefits and practices in your field Toxic positivity. Yup it‚Äôs a thing. A culture where everything is rosy and everyone‚Äôs ideas are ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù. This leads to an artificially safe environment that collapses as soon as the business hits a bad month/quarter and suddenly everyone has to snap into shape. Fire even one person for performance and everyone feels betrayed. Since you ask, the fastest way to kill team morale would be to kill the team members using a method which kills them instantly. Don't be tone deaf. Your employees will never have as much skin in the game as you do or as much upside as you do. Expecting them to wake up every day excited to bring value to your investors is impossible. My husband's boss lives in a multimillion dollar home on Mercer Island and they announced at the end of the year all hands that they're going from unlimited PTO to 15 days. Lack of communication, critical to include key staff in the journey so they feel a part of the process and a valued member. You don't need to share everything but regular updates. Never assume an employee doesn't have the skills to add valuable input. Even if they don't, it will be valuable to employee to be part of the process...I could go on and on, but I'll stop.. ) Pay people extra well and nothing else matters -- we overcome bad communication, micromanaging, and unclear goals -- it's the recipe for so many startups. One aspect that should always be clear in a small environment, however, is P&L. So there are no surprises and all hands on deck if need be. A startup can be a family, but dysfunctional if no one talks about the money. Micro-managing will do that right away. Hire slow.  Fire fast will solve these problems. Egos!!! Territorial departments. When you‚Äôre small but are experiencing growth, the organizational is coming together with various departments forming and individuals spearheading those departments. The nature of a startup can breed individuals who see the opportunities in front of them and want to capitalize on it. Usually starts with them owning their department and delivering positive results, the ego starts taking over a bit and now they start having opinion on how others should be running their departments. 

If this is not checked early, it can lead to a toxic culture of blame or stepping over others toes when everyone‚Äôs focus should be the organizational goals for the startup. You can then have internal teams operating in silos and that is not a good thing for a startup. Micromanaging, excessive tracking of kpis and ""employee of the month"" Appear cheerful. That's contagious. Treat everyone as friends. Weak leadership hands down Avoid at all cost - ""We are running out of money"" 

Nothing kills team morale faster. A toxic employee can be extremely damaging for team morale in the long run, even if they're very useful. Try to fire them early so they won't slowly poison the whole startup Hinting someone they might not get paid for any reason. People are complicated. The best you can do is be a genuine and empathetic human, then hire likeminded people.

Hire slow and deliberately. 

Tensions run high in a startup. There‚Äôs work/emergencies piling up and not enough resources. Employees will rarely care as much as the founders. The founders need to do 10x more than employees. Lead by example. And just be a nice person. It‚Äôs always better to be nice, the alternatives are, at best, a very short term solution. Hiring bad coworkers hurts morale, keeping them around and promoting them destroys it. E.g. we had a data analyst in a previous company who worked great with the executive team but was a terrible coworker to anyone outside of leadership. Took us a while to realize it so we kept him around too long, until we had reason to dig in, and when we did realized that folks were on the verge of quitting because of this person's apparent success. We parted ways with the analyst and the team has never performed better.¬† - Demanding full-time working in-office unless it's actually necessary to do the work.¬†
- Constantly changing directions/priorities
- blaming the workers when the exec plans don't work out as well as hoped. I.e. ""company missed some quarterly goal because the developers aren't working enough so we are gonna install monitoring software to make sure we're getting our 8 hours of work out of everyone"" Developers often form advisory team of professionals to help them with technical matters and provide guidance from the business start-up through the growth phase.

¬†Consequently, it‚Äôs crucial to select members who are experienced and knowledgeable and willing to work with the developer‚Äôs best interests in mind.

¬†Candidates should demonstrate a commitment to team success and shared goals and understand that more is achieved together than separately.

¬†The team and what is best for the business must take precedence over individual goals and egos.

¬†Successful project teams are motivated and engaged and should aim for the business‚Äôs success rather than their own. In a startup, one thing I‚Äôve found to be quite detrimental is:

1. Not being transparent with the companies mission and current standing. When salaries are low the mission is vital, share it and reward good employees with stock options, profit sharing anything to make up for the below market rates.

2. Lack of CPD and development. Startups are scrappy and founders usually understand this. Younger employees with limited experience need growth and don‚Äôt get the fake it til you make. This will naturally comes from being more generalist, but formalising this with profesional courses (even just a Coursera subscription) and the right sort of exposure is vital can be empowering to them. Strangely enough, performance based bonuses and recognition. I tried that for a while, and it really flopped.  I did that on a monthly basis for a while.  My idea was that I would recognize a particular good performance or innovative improvement with a thank you and a bonus of a few hundred dollars and a brief explanation why this performance was exemplary. I tried to reward different types of performances among our small team.  One month in engineering, next month someone in production etc.

But no matter who received this monthly bonus, others would feel slighted, their contribution overlooked or not valued. It got so bad that one month the recipient told me to never award them again.  

Well, I stopped the program and no one regretted it. Hiring new employees is tough and as hard as you try to avoid it, there will be bad fits. Your only mistake will be not removing the bad fits. Don‚Äôt hire people only in it for money. Team building events and off sites are much more important for camaraderie Agreed. Along with 2 - rewarding high-performing employees who don‚Äôt help others and removing mid-performing employees who are team-builders. Number 2 is such a good point. Higher management should pay real attention to who actually puts in the hard work. Not just the ones who claim they do the work. This has always been partnered with micromanaging in my experience. 

At my current gig, everything is a struggle with the CTO. He hired me because his knowledge of software is stuck in 1998. He says that everywhere he's worked, software has ended up being harder to change than the hardware. Then he says he wants to build the software the same way he's seen at his other companies. The desire to do things the same and expect a different outcome is always impressive.

I told the company that they needed to replace me. They've had some good candidates, but they don't accept the offers. The most recent candidate failed the technical evaluation. He was also stuck in 90s software approaches. Anyone who treats version control as new technology should be automatically excluded. But, surprise, they extended the offer anyway (accepted). I'll be out of here at the end of next month (I wanted to max out my 401(k) before doing my own startup). Straight up mentally insane evil psychopaths that'll charm the pants and seduce the opposite sex board members while slandering you, sabotaging the business, and stealing credit for your accomplishments while blame shifting and scapegoating for their major fuckups.  And people believe it. Always a morale killer. You cannot have equal pay. I worked at a startup where one top engineer guy was making about 4x that of a recent graduate. The recent graduate was a tester and she complained when somehow the salaries were leaked (a different issue). She left and was barely noticed. The engineer redesigned the whole product, scaled it out, coached other members (including me) and become the CTO. Now he, years later, he runs his own business. So yeah merit based pay is the way! Yes, but the reverse.

The people weren‚Äôt wrong, the person who hired them were. 

The absolute fastest way is to

- Hire anyone you can / from gut feeling 
- Pay them a good wage so they will stay regardless how bad it gets
- micromanage because they aren‚Äôt fit for the job and you have to watch them because they are incompetent 
- Spend months training them but 1 step forward 2 steps back
- Then to top it off insult their intelligence and get angry at them 
- Keep promising it‚Äôll get better, don‚Äôt listen to them
- Expect them to just get better when you hired wrongly in the first place 

Basically, all this can be avoided by hiring WELL and having a stringent process to pick the top applicants, removing all bias, being more of a metricocrasy. Great point! strong team culture is such a valuable way to prevent morale issues! Thanks for sharing. Hey there I have two business ideas and id want to hear someones opinion can I send you a message I totally agree!

So, what's the compromise? Who works for the money, anyway? Aren't most people in it for the team building and the cause? (Goes to burn journalism diploma but recalls she did that 10 years ago.) Absolutely not. Overpaying the wrong people will mean those people will just stay around for the salary, they‚Äôll avoid work, trick you and won‚Äôt actually care about the vision. 

Pay the RIGHT people WELL. People who naturally align with your vision. As in, if you weren‚Äôt paying them, they would be doing this job anyway.

You can‚Äôt just say ‚Äúpay people well‚Äù and expect to magically have good people in your company. 

The key part is defining a mission that everyone gets behind and works towards. \> You can‚Äôt just say ‚Äúpay people well‚Äù and expect to magically have good people in your company.

But paying people badly will guarantee you get bad people. There's never any magic. I assume you hire well.",2025-01-16 23:31:50

I would focus on your strengths opposed to what others are. What are you passionate about and really good at? Once you have that, you just need to find out how to leverage it. Just remember that someone's stupid idea is now making them millions. While going about your day, if you ever have a thought ""This would be an awesome business"" do yourself a favor and at least research it. I totally get where you're coming from. It‚Äôs not exactly straightforward. Some people just seem like they have a radar for these things. But you can definitely train yourself to spot opportunities. From my experience, it‚Äôs all about observation and asking questions. Next time you find yourself at a store or using a product, take a moment to think about what‚Äôs missing or what could be improved. Write down those ideas. Even if nothing comes to mind at first, it‚Äôs about building the habit.

Talking to people around you can help too, whether they‚Äôre in the business world or not. For a while, a big chunk of my time was chatting with different folks about their daily routines and the little annoyances they face. Sometimes, all it takes is to fix a small inconvenience.

If there‚Äôs a hobby or industry you have a particular interest in, dive deeper into it. You might discover things that need attention just because you know the ins and outs more than the average person. My friend once turned his love for coffee into a side hustle by realizing how wasteful coffee shops were with their grounds and offering them to gardeners for compost.

You gotta be curious and open-minded. Even scrolling through social media or forums can open your eyes to consumer complaints or requests. So anyway, stick with it and keep your eyes peeled. You never know when an idea will pop up, you could just be walking down the street and suddenly go, ‚ÄúOh hey, what about this?‚Äù You don‚Äôt have to have a unique idea.

You just need to provide a solution to a need.

People need:
Lawns cut,
Child care,
Cars detailed,
Decks power washed,
Pets walked,
Kids tutored,
Food delivered,
Moving services,
Junk removal,
Elderly care,
Copywriting,
Personal trainers,
House painting,
A good DJ‚Ä¶

And the list goes on. Find a need and fill a need. The money will follow. Stick to one idea that seems really good, and can be relevant long term, with intense focus for at least 2 years before thinking about jumping to the next idea. This way you can give the business a chance to get going and build traction. Usually, things don‚Äôt pick up right away I am like the guy you described. 20 business ideas come to me and I want to do all of them and sometime I do them and they are successful but I get bored of it then sell it or close it until the next idea. Trust me it‚Äôs not good at all. Find something real common and do it very good. This is what you want. What you described is super cool in the beginning but gets old quick >How can I find gaps in the market?

Our services include staffing solutions, software development, logo and UI/UX design, as well as business strategy and consulting. I mentioned it to them for free. I have a full recruiting team and ",great,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i36akn/just_got_off_a_call_where_client_wants_to_cut_our/,"Just got off a call where client wants to cut our fees because we're ""too efficient"" at finding talent. Had to hit my punching bag after this one.","Still fuming from this call 30 minutes ago.

After we filled 6 technical roles their internal recruiter couldn't fill in 8 months, after our placements helped them increase revenue by 30% through new contracts, they hit me with:

""You're filling roles too quickly - we should reduce your placement fees. We could just hire our own technical recruiter with this money.""

Had to mute myself and take a deep breath. Reminded them they HAD an internal recruiter who couldn't fill ONE role while they were bleeding contracts. We filled SIX with top talent who are all still there crushing it.

Currently working from home and just had to step away to hit my punching bag. The audacity of trying to penalize us for being good at our job.

Anyone else dealing with clients today who suddenly think you're ""too expensive"" right after you prove your worth?

  
Edit: Still at my desk trying to process this. They were losing contracts for 8 months because they couldn't staff up. We solve their problem in weeks and suddenly our fees are the issue, but I am really grateful for the feedback from the community!","I just state my prices are non-negotiable. If they would prefer to shop around, I understand . The I backfill my schedule and let them know it will take me longer to get there. That reminds me of the old story about a restaurateur calling in a plumber because the stink in the kitchen was so bad,  the plumber says I can fix that for $100.  The owner pays; the plumber fills a bucket and dumps it in the drain on the floor.  Perplexed; the owner says; what did you do that for?  Plumber says your trap under the floor was dry allowing sewer smells in the kitchen.  Owner said; ‚Äú I could have done that‚Äù.  Plumber; why didn‚Äôt you? I quit fuming some time ago about it.  Now I just graciously part ways.  When they come back (and they usually do), i assess a stupid tax/surcharge of 30% above the original base daily rate (consulting and not recruiting).  When asked about it, I usually just explain that I have less overhead coverage than I have to have due to some poor customers.... Just let them. I also wouldn‚Äôt take it personal. They‚Äôre a company that (although not always logical) will always try to save money. Just hold strong, don‚Äôt bend to their demands and let your great reputation grow.

If they leave let them know they‚Äôre always welcome back if they need your services again. 

They‚Äôre just trying to cut costs even if the way they‚Äôre doing it is nonsensical. They don‚Äôt care if it really makes sense so long as it works. ""I understand. Not everyone can afford my quick, quality service. We will be here if you need us in the future .."" This is a prime example of the concept of Cheap, Fast, and Good - you only get 2 of the 3.

You want it cheap and fast, it won‚Äôt be good quality.
You want it fast and good, it won‚Äôt be cheap - get your pocketbook out.
You want it good and cheap, you won‚Äôt get it fast - good and cheap takes time.

Pick your poison.

Not enough business people fully understand this concept - this is a great way to set proper expectations with client right out of the gate. Hit those 6 back up and hire them away to a better client. Ask if you should fill that position for them at full rate of course.

I know it‚Äôs difficult, but do not get emotional. They just don't want to feel like they're being ripped off. Just remind them of the value you're providing them with and that most people end up paying much more, they're making a very smart decision by working with you and they're getting the best rate that's available in the market. Actually, you could hit them back with something like this: 

While we have a sense of urgency so we'll always be quick and efficient at filling these roles, but what really matters is the results the people we fill these roles drive. So if you're like to switch to success based pricing, whereby our fee fluctuates relative to the performance of the candidates we provide you, I'm more than happy to accommodate you. Although, be advised this arrangement may be more expensive for you, and we would need audit access to the sales commission data from our candidates. etc It‚Äôs ridiculous ridiculous fee is probably less that what they would have to pay a full time employee and all that goes with that the taxes, ins benefits etc. Plus you‚Äôre actually making them money. Always be an ally. It sounds like a good business relationship showing some signs of stress. I agree; stay firm and objective on pricing. However, I try to remain understanding to the request and dig a little deeper on why this is coming up. That knowledge will help you later. 

Let‚Äôs say they are scaling, but didn‚Äôt budget for scalding costs. Remind them that outsourcing allows them to auto scale when the expansion phase is over. Onboarding a replacement takes 6 months minimum and the needs are immediate. Are they willing to make that gamble to save that money? Ask them what they will do when they are done?  Immediately fire the RFT recruiter costing x1.6 their salary?

Maybe the client is getting heat and needs something to show. Give him a one time discount to get his boss off his back. 

They have problems and you are the solution. Sometimes you have to remind them of that. However, it only happens within the context of how they see the problems. If it really does come down to them having better options then you make the choice to accommodate or go. 

One more thought on this. You may also uncover some deeper trends within your industry. Probing these problems with multiple clients gives you better insights on market trends. Be an Ally. Just tell em that's fine. Those guys have my number. They'll call me in 6 months and i'll place them at your biggest competitor. The thing is they might just be lying to your face, when the reality is these top talented people were connected to other equally talented people and all the roles they needed filled are filled now, so they no longer need your services. The reduction in fee is because the need is gone. But if you have other people to send them of similiar quality they won't mind paying less for them. How did you get their business in the first place? Did you used to work there? Pretty simple.  Capture any savings, avoidance, growth, EBITDA improvement & etc that we provide which is out of scope and or above deliverable.  We work on pre-acquisition due diligence,value creation planning  and implementation, and then taking to market, so we have to track a lot of it anyway and have access to the data. Hard not to laugh at these people. Not all customers are good customers. Not all money is good money. Sometimes its ok just to fire your own customers. If they come back, charge more. Just say no thank you. Are you charging on a contingency basis, ie a percentage of first-year salary? Adding to the vent session ‚Äî just had a customer after 9 months of weekly hour long meetings say ‚Äúthey weren‚Äôt consulted enough‚Äù on the work and therefore don‚Äôt understand or believe in the project. As in they want to start from scratch.

Then when told it would cost more to add meetings / hours to start over, they said it wasn‚Äôt transparent that weekly meetings counted against their contractual consulting hours. 

Then they just stared at me as if I was about to admit that I meet them for hour long sessions where they change their minds every 2 months just for fun‚Äôs sake. Like wtf? I had to actually read their contract to reassure myself that meetings are included in the hours. Because they acted so affronted I was actually like ‚Äúthey‚Äôre going to pull legal on this.‚Äù

Then I calmed down from the panic and was just tiredly  enraged.

Idk man ‚Äî maybe I need a punching bag too.  Thanks for reminding me to put a new clause in the contract. They think it‚Äôs easy because your crushing it ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just very good at this, which is how we earn those fees‚Äù. With an attitude like that, it‚Äôs *such a mystery* how they failed to recruit on their own.

If their criteria for cutting the budget of something is that it *works,* I imagine the place is going to be in trouble recruiting-wise again in a few months anyway I'm not sure what the commercial agreement looks like, but follow that re early termination.

Use this as a case study, make it a positive and replace one client with two on the back of your excellent services. 

Win win for both business. Future repeat work in the bag. 

No one cares about what a client employee does or does not do, drop that. 

Lee ""If that's the direction to choose to go in, I can't stop you. However, we will not honor our previous fee structure, as we have kept a steady fee structure due to loyalty.""

Then when they come back, bump the cost up 10% Have you tried to just record the initial calls, use ai to summarise it and send this attached with the contract? It would be their word against... their word? They couldnt possibly deny saying ""we are in deep shit, help us"" And just like that, the price went up ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The issue is that your customer has the perception that they are paying you for your time spent looking for new employees, not for the results you produce.  You need to change that perception or you'll ultimately lose clients, much like this one.  You did a fantastic job for them, but they're unhappy.  That means their expectations and yours aren't the same. Let me share something provocative that'll flip this frustrating situation on its head - this isn't about your efficiency, it's about their insecurity! üéØ

Here's the uncomfortable truth after years of entrepreneurship: When clients say you're ""too expensive"" right after you crush it for them, they're actually saying ""We're scared we're too dependent on you."" Think about it - you just proved their internal team couldn't match your results in 8x the time!

Want to hear something that'll really bake your noodle? This is actually a PERFECT opportunity to raise your rates, not lower them! When someone says ""you're too efficient,"" what they're really saying is ""you're delivering more value than we expected.""

Here's what nobody's talking about: The real conversation isn't about your fees - it's about their ROI. Let's do the math: They got a 30% revenue increase through new contracts because of YOUR placements. Ask them what that's worth in actual dollars. Then ask them what an 8-month revenue delay costs them.

Want to know the craziest part? Some of my best client relationships started with similar conversations. Here's how I flip it: ""You're right - we ARE incredibly efficient. That's why companies pay us a premium. Would you rather pay more for guaranteed results or less for 8 months of uncertainty?""

The real secret? Don't defend your prices - defend your value. I'd respond with something like: ""I understand you could hire an internal recruiter. But you did have one - for 8 months. How much did those 8 months of unfilled positions cost you in lost contracts?""

Think about it differently: You're not just filling positions - you're preventing revenue loss, ensuring project delivery, and maintaining their market position. That's worth a premium!

What specific value metrics could you highlight to remind them why they hired you in the first place? Start there! üí™ ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy to discuss this further when we meet to discuss our next contract.‚Äù

Then, don‚Äôt budge and tell them exactly what your already tell them. Show them the money. Give them the option to go that route again like you said. But don‚Äôt budge on price. ‚ÄúWork for full price or work for free. Do not work for cheap.‚Äù You don‚Äôt need clients like that, not worth your energy or stress. Walk away and they‚Äôll be crawling back. Wow, that‚Äôs infuriating‚Äîand completely unjustified. honestly? im good at my job too and when clients start giving me shit about being too good and trying to dick me over i just politely removed myself from the scenario and let them catch on fire. They always come back and suddenly my rates are up 30%.

  
\*shrug\* When your good finding clients arnt an issue if you wanna burn a working system let them catch on fire.

  
It's a 2 way street and sometimes letting a client walk on you is setting a bad example for the future.

  
Now if im starving it would be a different story but it's hard to find good help nowadays.

  
GL This is something that I would mention to the client:

The cost of a bad hiring decision can be significant. Every time a hire doesn't meet expectations, it's not just a financial expense; it also consumes the time of the rest of the team, who must spend time onboarding the new employee. 

From experience, this often puts team members behind on their projects, and ultimately, the customer is the most affected party.

Our hiring process ensures that every candidate is thoroughly vetted to minimize the risk of a quick decision.

Do you truly believe that putting the bottom line at risk is a wise move just to save some money upfront? I understand that cost-saving is important, but it's crucial to consider the long-term impact as well. Hit em with a retainer and % of growth results. You‚Äôre paid for the years of experience not the hours you spend Just fire the client and move on. No, point in wasting any energy on the bs. I've also said, ""Okay, good luck.""  And fired them as a client.  A few months later they came back and never hassled me about my fees. How high up in the company is the person you're dealing with?

Business people (& owners) have natural agendas to constantly push for margins to go further towards their favor.   It's their role, it's why they exist.   They can't let facts or logic muddy their agenda.   

The person you were communicating with was saying ""The number of successful deals we have done recently must represent a significant chunk of your bottom line.  You need me, and I will leverage that information to squeeze your margins.""

Their comments aren't reflective of what the successful deals/placements has delivered for them.    Next time, just stop talking for a healthy period.    Breathe.   Let the guy talk.    And when you're ready...     Just laugh in his face.   Go over the top.  ""Hahahaha.   I'm crying man, I almost thought you were serious."". N etc

Cliffs =  fish go downstream, they always want a better price.
Laugh it off, preferably in their face. You should legally change your name to ROI. I wouldn't treat it as a ""stand off"", just toss them the responsibility ball by discussing money: how much value you made them, how much their other option will actually cost them, in other words the implication of NOT using your services.

it's not like they don't think you did a good job; rather they failed to see it's full value. No one can argue against numbers, especially if it's money. That reminds me of a story my dad used to tell 

An oil tanker engine had seized up and they had to call in a specialist. The owner thought it was going to be a full replacement, which would have been incredibly expensive. 

The specialist arrived and started an inspection. He walked around, looked, poked, made some thoughtful noises.

After a few minutes he says ""I can fix this for you, but it isn't going to be cheap.""

The owner agrees and tells him to proceed.

He takes a small hammer out and knocks twice in one spot, then twice in another. Viola! The engine starts up.

He hands the owner a bill for $20,000.

Outraged, the owner says ""I need you to itemize this, all you did was knock on the engine a few times.""

""No problem"" replies the specialist.

He hands him an itemized bill, it says 

""4 knocks with a hammer"" $5
""Knowing where to knock"" $19,995 Increase your rates for this client I took a client from 2 assets with a net worth of $3M to 12 assets with a net worth of $200M+ in less than 4 years. My reward was to be fired for an internal team and failed to pay me for my last 2.5 months of the contract. The contract stated he could leave anytime with a 90 day notice. He paid 15 out of 90 days. 

It‚Äôs been almost a year. Rumor is he‚Äôs down and over leveraged significantly from some poorly timed refinances with a couple of bridge to HUD loans. As well as he‚Äôs had to hire multiple more people leading to him not saving on my fee as was the original goal. 

We could sue but thanks to me he has more $$$ than me now (role reversal) and could hang out in court longer. My only hope is to be around to watch karma for some type of small feeling of justice. I quit management consulting forever from this experience‚Ä¶ ""So you'll pay me more for doing my job worse?"" Too soon? Lmao what kind of business asks you to hire slow? they sound stupid. In these types of scenarios I like to encourage them to pursue that option- they always end up coming back Heyyyy any scrum master or project management positions open?

Not for that company though, they sound dumb and cheap. I‚Äôve seen some of these finding fees as high as $10,000 I may be a potential candidate for technical roles if you‚Äôre looking for more.¬† What kind of business do you run ? Just fill their positions slower, problem solved I work in recruiting too. Take little longer to fill the roles. Or let them know that you had to use a huge team or spend X number of hours to find the candidate and that's why you worked quick.

It's clear you're a good recruiter. Thankfully my business partner is an amazing recruiter so I learned from him. Most recruiters suck and they would have been able to easily find a recruiter who could do the work that you do because recruiters like you are rare.

Also make sure you get them to calculate how much money they lost out on by not filling the role for 8 months. I'm pretty sure it's no where near your fee. Always reminded of this video when I hear stuff like this

https://youtube.com/shorts/5PexQJkA7Fc?si=VK3M5R1K8TLwKFkc

You shouldn‚Äôt be penalized for being good at your job.
Best of luck Tell them if they want any more workers, it'll be double Excellent feedback all the same, shows you are doing an amazing service. Can you reduce the placement fee and add them to a retainer model instead Meh, I don't think there's particular ill will to you in this, he's just seeing say 180k in placement fees as a cost item and thought to himself that he could hire someone for that number.


I'd be saying something like ""of course, if the placement fees are hitting your costs too much at one time we can delay sending you talent, but when we find people we think are the right fit for a customer we get excited and like to share right away. Otherwise if you'd prefer to recruit internally and save the costs entirely, we understand entirely, but it was my understanding that your team hadn't been able to recruit for these roles in 8 months and that we helped you out of a bit of a sticky situation""


It's just someone costing effort, not output. It's like that scenario where you need something vital, and someone says ""I can make that for you, but it'll take me a full year and so it'll cost you 10,000. You'd probably think it's worth it. Now if someone else turns round and says ""I can make one tomorrow - cost will be 10,000"" - even though it's the same price and you're getting it a year earlier, to a lot of people it feels less value for money. You can always cut your effort and be less efficient if that‚Äôs what they want. If you can spend less in an equal amount they demand to lower your fees you can keep the relationship without cutting them out. I had a client try to renogtiate my contract after saying my workers did the job too quickly. Turn it into a math problem. ‚ÄúJust out of curiosity what did that 30% of revenue mean to you in terms of dollars per month?‚Äù By waiting 8 months for your recruiter to unsuccessfully find and hire this talent costed you x. With that in mind, are my fees really that expensive?‚Äù Ridiculous lol.

I own a technical recruiting firm as well. Out of curiosity what kinda fees are you charging? Good. Fast. Cheap.

Pick two‚Ä¶

You can have it good and fast, but it ain‚Äôt cheap.

Fast and cheap, but it ain‚Äôt good.

Or good and cheap‚Ä¶but it ain‚Äôt fast. Yeah ""I'm sorry we were too successful too quickly. We'll slow down"" Easy fix. Tell 'em to take it or leave it. Be ready to lose a client.  But NEVER talk negative of the client.

Or just take it as humour: Laugh to the made joke. And change subject. So you're creating too much value that far exceeds your price? Sounds like super positive feedback that you can keep scaling your business. 

Could you make your existing offer be super premium and priced as an anchor, and deliver a more minimal offer for 10% of what it costs you to fulfill your current one? 

Imagine From their perspective, if you pay for 10 gigs of cell phone data every month but you only use 2, why would you want to keep paying for all 10? It's not penalizing you for doing a good job, it's trying to match their usage to their spend. Now it's up to you to decide if changing your offer is profitable... or to just walk away. Math. This is like a time my wife and I purchased a used car from CarMax for $16,000.  It was a sporty, but automatic shifting Honda Fit (though it did have steering wheel shifting paddles that worked, but you didn't need to use them at all.)

She showed a photo of her new CarMax car on Facebook and a long time friend who had moved to Italy contacted me to ask why we hadn't just purchased her old car she wasn't able to take with her when she moved to Italy.  

It turned out she was trying to sell a very comparable car and was asking $14000 for it.  

My wife *liked* the CarMax car better because it was stick shift, otherwise the two were mostly the exact same car.  One year apart with the CarMax one a year newer, but they were the same color, Make, Model.  Both had almost exactly 32,000 miles.

We discussed and confirmed the price my friend was asking and decided to go ahead and return the car to CarMax.  

We got a Money Order for $14,000, provided it to my friend's family who was in the next city over, and took possession of the ""new"" used car, happy in our knowledge that the true reason my friend was sold it was that she couldn't use it, and not that there was something wrong with it. 

Right away we discovered a little chunk of rubber gouged from one of the tires, and though we could have milked the tires a while longer, we decided safety was more important and we replaced all four tires and didn't even complain to the seller about it.  

After about a week we were enjoying this car and my friend contacted me saying, ""You don't have to do this, but I'm thinking I should have asked for more for the car.  I am requesting an additional $500 for the car.""  

I couldn't believe it.  I verified I was understanding her request accurately and politely declined to pay her anything more for the car.  

We literally paid exactly what she was asking without trying to negotiate it lower or anything.  

The savings were most of the reason we took the deal (even though the one from CarMax was truly closer to what my wife wanted.). Helping out a friend was an additional bonus.

Well, we have literally not heard from that friend since then, around ten years ago.  I tried reaching out a couple of times, but ultimately just accepted that the friendship was over. 

I think what I learned is that we sometimes have to play the stupid game.  Like when the inlaws offer me something I don't want to eat, it feels pushy.  My family doesn't do that.  Or like when we are about to head out to a restaurant but we haven't picked out a place to go, yet, there's this whole stupid game about ""Where do you want to go"" and everyone pretends not to have a preference, and the question gets asked over and over.  

I can never stand it.  I just go right ahead and state where I want to go.  

I don't want to play the games.  I don't want to haggle for prices.  I don't want to act like I'm hungry or not hungry. I don't want to pretend I don't know what restaurant I want to go to.  

Cultures are so annoying sometimes when they're not *my* culture! Efficiency is always punished by more work. So frustrating Present the benefits as befire you and after you. Otherwise, they just see your work as placing, not the difference you made. Show them where they would have been without you.
Let them know that you can recruit out of them as opposed to into them. They can be your source for people.  If they treated you that way, I am sure they do the same with their other performers too. That allows you to recruit out. A client attempting to penalize success is frustrating but fairly common in consulting. Consider reframing the conversation around value delivered (30% revenue increase, 6 successful placements) rather than time spent. If they want to go internal, let them - but keep the relationship professional. 

They may well come back when they realize quality recruiting isn't just about posting job ads. Tell them we have already spent 8 months on talent  you got. So we should actually be charging more on  our services! Raise prices if they don‚Äôt like it fire them Well you can always pull the ""we were already cutting you a break, I was thinking we need to back to our regular rates which are x% higher"" Geezuz that logic sounds an awful lot like the company I just left. It isn‚Äôt a credit union, is it? Sometimes you need to politely remind a client that the reason they're paying you is bc they were failing miserably on their own. This is where having a quick wit combined with polite tact can keep it from pissing them off. Try and create a win-win situation out of this for both sides. They know you did great work for them when their internal recruiter couldn't. Why burn a bridge because they are trying to save money even if it sounds shitty ? It is nothing personal. Here is what I will respond with:

  
""I think I have been able to find you great candidates quickly which actually saves you time and money in the long run. Respectfully, the reason I got you these candidates was because you last internal recruiter couldn't. However, I understand that it seems a bit too much for you when I filled so many roles so quickly. I can think about adding a bulk discount if you accept my candidates within a <xyz> time period. That way, it can be win-win for both sides. What do you think ? ""

Then wait. Leverage your confidence. Just go ok, no problem. Happy for you to rehire your internal person. You‚Äôve got my number. When they come back, up your rates. Just contact the candidates and help them get placement in another company. Then you block the client on all your mobile. üòà Remind them that the time and costs you invested into becoming ‚Äúefficient‚Äù justifies the price. I say if that price fits your business needs go ahead. How can I find a SaaS /fintech recruiter? If you are fuming for over half an hour from a call like this, you shouldn't be in business.... or at least not on the client facing side of things. If his logic is to pay for time you are too expensive. It ain't about you Don‚Äôt know your book of business but it‚Äôs perfectly fine to fire customers. It sounds like you need to RAISE your fees. I like this!! Yup. Same old story of ‚Äúyou pay me $1 to screw in a screw and $99 to know which one to screw in‚Äù $5 og bucket and $95 of education. Pretty nice deal. Only 19 more buckets for the education to pay for itself, and the whole thing turn into pure profit. Yeah, maybe time to remind the client that they pay for outcomes not effort. If they want the jobs filled more slowly, I'm sure OP could provide that service in order to justify the prices, but we all know that would be idiotic.¬† I‚Äôm just here to thank you for not putting an N in ‚Äúrestaurateur.‚Äù I feel like it‚Äôs almost always misspelled. To paraphrase a quote from software development: ""If a good recruiter is too expensive for you, maybe you try a bad one"" I love this response. You could even say, ""Hey, you're locked in right now, my prices have already gone up. So go ahead and think about it between here and the next call."" Oh shit I gave similar advice before seeing this! Love it.¬† Love this!!!  >I have less overhead coverage than I have to have 

Can you explain this for a layman? They are going to lose money in the long run with this short-sighted, 2D thinking. Sometimes, you lose money to win, and other times, you save money and lose. In the end, they‚Äôll realize their mistake and come back. By then the CHARGES will also GO UP! That is good Exactly. In the wisdom of Dojacat, ""Do it, motherfucker. I won't stop you"". Sounds like a great way to lose the client for good I agree with you!! i think sometimes we can still get cheap, fast and good, but just not ""great"" This would actually save them from the toxic culture down the line and make them more likely to want to work with you again in the future. Also do you work with non engineers for placement? Thinking about this. This is the way I like this, thank you This is the best advice. Your job is to continually sell the value of your services to your clients. They should understand your process and how you‚Äôre delivering results. I see what you mean I love this!! Sometimes with some customers, I don't even know Great perspective! That is true because I always maintain a great relationship with the candidates. That is another perspective, I agree I didn‚Äôt work there, but I had been cultivating relationships for months while they struggled to fill those open roles. Eventually, I was able to convince them to try one of our candidates. Agreed Yes, it‚Äôs a percentage of the salary. On top of that, I negotiate the salary in a way that saves the company money while keeping the candidate happy. Trust we all need the punching bag, it definitely helps all of us out! This is crazy! I love this take , it paints the  bigger picture. I like this one, okay this is a new perspective!!! The one thinking about the money that they gonna pay you. when they come back, they should be triple charged I don't have a scrum role but when I do I will be in touch send me your DM with your details. lol, no. Recruiters typically cost 1/3 of a hire‚Äôs annual salary. OP is talking tens of thousands more than that Dm me your resume I will take a look. I run a consulting firm that uses a unique approach called the BAAB (Business as a Baby) Framework. We categorize companies as Baby, Toddler, Teenager, or Adult based on their stage of development. The client I‚Äôm currently working with falls under the 'Teenager' category, which comes with certain characteristics typical of this stage.

Our services include staffing solutions, software development, logo and UI/UX design, as well as business strategy and consulting. I mentioned it to them for free. I have a full recruiting team and system in place. 

From a technical interviewer and AI-recorded interviews to a sourcer and account manager, they get the whole package. 

What‚Äôs funny is that I had to train each team member over time on different aspects of recruitment. 

Good luck replacing a recruiting machine with just one individual! I love this video that is what I am feeling right now!! That‚Äôs exactly what I did, but they wanted to reduce the placement fee further. I didn‚Äôt mind initially, as the volume of placements increased, which made it reasonable. 

However, they came back wanting to lower it again it felt like they were trying to cap how much I could earn rather than just reducing their costs. 

They kept saying things like, ‚ÄúWhy would we pay you this amount when we could hire a recruiter for less?‚Äù Interesting perspective will pause and reflect on this Wow that is interesting I charge industry rate I already offered a bulk discount, but they came back wanting to reduce it even further. Send a DM I was fuming in private That is their logic. I see what you mean This will be part of the second series, Business as a Toddler, which focuses on how to get your business to start thriving. The book coming out now is Business as a Baby. I don't retaliate, I quoted the price I could do the job for. If someone does it cheaper than great, I hope it works out for them. If they can't find someone cheaper and come back, we'll hopefully I haven't went somewhere else. Three things:

1 - completely reasonable to want a reduction in fees as a large customer.  You don't get paid on the revenue the hires you found bring; you get paid on how hard it is to replace you.  Their recruiter before seems not to have been good, but that doesn't mean they can't find a good one.  This is no different than a volume discount anywhere else, and it would be strange to charge the same fees to a company that runs one hire every couple years through you as one that runs a full team at a go regularly.

2 - completely reasonable to refuse if you're comfortable with them leaving.

3 - you should think through your alternatives because the economy isn't exactly booming.  Of course, if you're fully booked elsewhere, then good for you. That feels good, but u still lose.  I would put the numbers you outlined on one sheet of paper and send it to them. Tell em, ""Well, I will not be blackmailed by some ineffectual, privileged, effete, soft-penised, debutante. You want to start a street fight with me bring it on but you're gonna be surprised by how ugly it gets, you don't even know my real name- I'm the f***ing lizard king!"" Exactly.  People don‚Äôt understand you‚Äôre paying for KNOWLEDGE, also.  Because if you ‚Äúcould‚Äôve done that too,‚Äù then why didn‚Äôt you????  The person‚Äôs time to come out is also very valuable too.  So an idiot might sit back and say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a rip off, all he did was throw a bucket of water.‚Äù  No, he took his own time to come out and used his brain/knowledge (that you didn‚Äôt have on that topic) to solve your problem. $100 to know, the action is free Bad recruitment doesn‚Äôt show up as an expense on a balance sheet, and some people only look at that. Absolutely.  It is, and should be a stupid tax.
Nine times out of 10 when they come back they are in more dire straits then they were originally. Sure.  My costs are broken out the same as every other business in Cost of Goods/Services Sold: OH, SG&A, Direct Labor, Material.
Every bill/invoice is made up by the total of the above numbers plus Margin/profit.  Overhead & SG&A are fixed and or fixed variable costs.  They get divided up equally across all billings.  The less billings I have, the higher the amount of OH & SG&A each bill has to cover. Companies step over a dollar to pick up a dime  all the time. I have seen more middle management teams penny wise and pound foolish when it comes to having to pay someone. Most businesses are run by people who don't know how to run a business so trying for short term gains over long term profits is pretty common Honestly the fact that they will lose money in the long run is not your problem. It's their business and if they want to make poor decisions, that's their prerogative. Just a thought. Perhaps that's what the staff member is telling you. Perhaps there are concerns internally that they will have a downturn and so whoever is more senior than the person you spoke to has said 'hey we need to try and reduce our cost base on hiring' (probably everything else as well.) People will say anything to try and justify a reduction and sometimes that's just because they want to go back to their boss to say they have said it or managed to negotiate it. 

I would try and understand if that's the case and then try and get them to understand their cost savings by using you. I'd also encourage them to go away and crunch the numbers because you won't be changing your prices anytime soon because you believe you are providing a fair exchange of value. 

Just because the person who you are speaking to works in a business doesn't mean they have business sense. ""We can certainly provide you with slower service if that would make you feel better about our prices."" Don‚Äôt be cunty to your clients, that‚Äôs a backhanded response. There is nothing wrong with them wanting to pay less, and there is nothing wrong with you holding firm. Be respectful, it‚Äôll get you further. For some clients, losing them is the only way to win. yw! This is the best perspective here. The rest is driven by frustration, which is fully understandable and might also work well as a sorting mechanism for customers you don't enjoy working with. But here, you might be able to learn the ""real"" pain point, address it, increase revenue, and cultivate an even better relationship. But if you are fed up, short answers with non-negotiable rates and adding a stupid tax when they return can also work just fine. Please don't take offense, OP, but I think there are a lot of people that think this is a lot of money for not that much work.  And, definitionally, if you're filling 6 roles in one month for a single client, and you're charging (say) 20% of year 1 salary, then you're costing the company 120% of a full-year technical salary for 1 month of HR recruiting work.  

Yeah, maybe you're ""just that good"" -- but maybe the person is reconsidering the deal structure, or wondering whether their previous employee was ""just that bad,"" given how easily you're able to fill these roles.  Maybe they're also wondering if there's an economy of scale, wherein filling 6 roles at the same company isn't actually 6 times the effort of filling one, and they wish they'd structured the deal accordingly.

Obviously your point of view would be they're paying for the value not the work, and in fact the faster you fill these roles, the more impact the filled roles can provide sooner (like reverse opportunity cost).  ""Knowing where to put the X,"" etc.  

But at some point people do feel like they're overpaying if they're charged for value that doesn't seem to require much work.  (Consider:  I'd pay $100,000 for someone to save my life if I had a heart attack... but if I got a bill for a 1-mile ambulance ride that was $100k, I would probably choke on that a little... wouldn't you?)

As with realtors, I have had experiences where I felt like they were overpaid for their efforts, and where they fully earned their commissions.

Either way, you can be pissed at the client, or you can recognize that if a client feels like they're overpaying you relative to the work contribution you're making, they're gonna have second thoughts about continuing the relationship. yes and it paints it in a true light as well.  You are adding value and should be compensated for that value.  When an expert electrician came to my house and updated some things.  I didn't pay him $$$ for that hour he spent here - I paid him for his expertise - which he spent years building.  Yeah he got it done super fast but the cost of that updated saved me $$ over the long haul in electric bills and potential fire damage.  People should be paid for the value then give not the hours the spend on it.  The trading hours for $$ is an employer mentality that only serves the employer :) I learned the hard way‚Ä¶ but also if you can have a nice results track record it‚Äôs easier to make that ask. Especially beforehand because if you don‚Äôt provide the results they‚Äôre safe from the fee‚Äôs so it‚Äôs only sweat equity risk on your part. But if they're not ready to hire why give you the search? seems weird. Obvious retribution isn't the way, but maybe a 30% or 40% increase can be explained away as ""new pricing"". Seriously! I come across way too many people like the one you encountered. They seriously lack critical thinking skills. Yeah he said you guys charged me 2k and got the job done with one person in 4 hours. Im like dude thats market rate fuck off. But said it nicer than thag x) Fair enough then. You can tell them nicely to go pound sand (in the most professional way of course). Sent! Maybe ""fuming"" was an exaggeration for effect on reddit? Agreed! Pity that when they come back, there's been a price increase and a renewal fee and additional service fee and paperwork filing fee and .... That's definitely true. Opportunity cost is a well known phrase but not many businesses actually act that way They know this. I don‚Äôt understand why someone is upset about paying money that was genuinely earned, not just clocking in and out, but truly earned resulting in a direct increase in their revenue. exactly, craziness Exactly, if I were OP I would inform them of the monetary savings/gains overall, fees considered THEN inform them that ""unfortunately fees are not negotiable, this is our set rate for all clients and as shown, reflects quality of service and speed"" or along those lines. Them maybe offer them a ""cost saving"" solution like filling roles more slowly since that seems to be pain point.  
 
After that if they want to walk, let em' walk. They may come back shortly after but won't with offhanded or emotionally driven correspondence. Some not all I see what you mean I will take a step back and reflect on this! Exactly because it is crazy I like this retribution. I don't know they like trying to inquire your own costs, how is that your business ? So, its customary for your company reward high performance with a reduction in pay? That's weird, what book is that from?¬† Edited for spelling Well it looks like you are doing great. If they cant pay your worth, let them go to find the next cheaper. Congrats üéä I either work for clients or I don't.  I can always be too busy to work for a bad client. In my industry, a bad client can cost more money than they are worth. I don't adjust prices, I just say no. The ‚ÄúAsshole Client‚Äù surcharge. I just add it to all my jobs now. Short sighted and greedy.  They don't understand that the short-term expense cut costs them their future.  I am always lost that clients panic in downturns and cut us to reduce costs when that is actually when they need us most and can provide the best path forward.
We track the returns we provide them over and above our contracted scope and deliverables, and it is always 7-10 times of their total expenditure to us.  That is precisely why I assess the stupid tax/surcharge. I am right in the middle of this situation right now and it is truly baffling. As if exceptional results and all the profit generated are a given, something they are entitled to, not something contributed by someone they are lucky will work with them. Really gross to see I also offer volume discount pricing as the number of placements increases to account such scenarios rather than completely cutting my prices. But your point is very valid and reasonable. Can't tell if you're joking but obviously they'd just go somewhere else if you tripled your price and I doubt they'd even care. Its a problem where people think they can do our work themselves. They think they're only hiring us to save themselves time or whatever delusion they tell themselves. 

What most don't understand is that the guy is working twice as fast as others because he has years of experience. And i spent time money and effort cultivating relationships to have the best workers. 

People are delusional and self agrandizing. the most perfect question to ask. ever. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre bleeding contracts. I think you fail to understand the extent of my avaricial approach to pricing. I'm not adjusting prices, I'm extorting the shirt off their backs. The surcharge can be refunded if the client fails to be an asshole, I hope! This makes a lot of sense, they will eventually learn. However, it mostly comes down to greed when someone focuses on what you‚Äôre earning instead of what they‚Äôre gaining, which is money you‚Äôve worked hard to generate for them. How are you able to assess the returns externally? Would love to get better at this. Right now, my mind is focused on the future, thinking about new clients and opportunities. It‚Äôs easy to start feeling turned off in situations like this, but we‚Äôve got to stay professional and respectful when we decide to part ways. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs nothing personal, it‚Äôs just business. Actually, I‚Äôm serious, if they try to come back, it‚Äôs just a way to weed out horrible customers. They‚Äôve already shown their true colors. Yes they are, yes they are I think he fully understood it.

He just refuses to play games. Good question. The possibility never crossed my mind. 

It‚Äôs not impossible the problem is me. Exactly. It is like the story about a production line that was shutdown and losing tens of thousands an hour, everyone was panicking and nobody knew what was wrong. 

Eventually they call in an old guy who looked up and down listened to a few things and hit one bit either a hammer and it suddenly roared back into life. The next day the manager complained that the bill was too large for 10 minutes work and asked for a breakdown of costs. The guy replied with ¬£50 call-out, ¬£2 to hit it with a hammer, and ¬£1000 for the experience to know where to hit it. Pretty simple.  Capture any savings, avoidance, growth, EBITDA improvement & etc that we provide which is out of scope and or above deliverable.  We work on pre-acquisition due diligence,value creation planning  and implementation, and then taking to market, so we have to track a lot of it anyway and have access to the data. That'll show em The difference is probably industry as well. We specialize in process safety management that is regulated by OSHA and the EPA. A bad client can not only cost us hundreds of thousands in fines but also the loss of reputation if they hurt or kill someone because of a chemical release. A client trying to renegotiate the contract after the work is already completed is a major red flag. That means they are going to undermine our efforts to get and maintain their facilities up to safety standards because, well, this cost too much. There is no amount of money we can make for a loss of reputation, let alone a loss of life. So, while I understand petty, it doesn't keep someone alive.",2025-01-16 21:34:04

I'm starting to develop an online business,  I have a good plan and in my opinion good chance to succeed.  

My only problem right now is time and energy, as I don't want to quit my current job.

was anybody here able to achieve that? get enough income from side business while still working, until your side business makes more?","Are you able to carve out a few hours every day before or after work? Consistency is the key here. I'm currently doing this. Working full time remote in tech, have creative ventures on the side.

Knowing how and where to dedicate your time is the key part of success. Oh man, it's definitely doable, but it can get tricky ‚Äì I‚Äôve been there myself. I tried juggling a 9 to 5 while ramping up my own side hustle, and it was a wild ride. I found that having a well-structured routine helped. I‚Äôd wake up an hour earlier to tackle some business tasks and squeeze in bits of work during lunch breaks. Evenings were for deep work, like developing ideas or handling customer queries. Weekends became key too, like mini sprints for the business. Oh, and setting clear boundaries was crucial. I‚Äôd occasionally let work spill into my business hours and vice versa and it was a mess.

But pacing yourself is important too. There were times I was running on fumes, and that doesn‚Äôt help anyone. Sometimes you have to be okay with slower progress to maintain your sanity. I learned to be patient with growth. Also, I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre considering it, but if you can delegate or automate even a part of your side hustle, do it. Even small tools or services can make a big difference. I remember outsourcing tasks like basic marketing or getting someone to handle customer support for a while, and that spiked my productivity.

I didn‚Äôt quit my job until my side business was pulling in a steady and reliable income. Having that buffer made the transition smoother. It's a bit like riding two bikes at once, balancing between security and passion. It was definitely a balancing act, but if you have the passion and drive, it‚Äôs worth the leap. You'll learn so much along the way. So, keep your eyes on the prize and try to enjoy the hustle. Set yourself achievable goals.
The overall concept (income replacement with a side hustle) is sound and low risk, though you will have to make sacrifices in terms of time.
There are also ways to create more time too. Get your groceries delivered instead of going to the store; stop watching crap on tv; delete pointless apps on your phone (candy crush etc); get up an hour earlier and spend that time on your business.
Good luck with your endeavours. It‚Äôs possible don‚Äôt make excuses Totally possible. If you love the business, you can find the time. If it feels like a chore, maybe you need to find a way to make it more exciting for you. I started my business while working about 60 hours a week in a full time job. I just loved it so much that it felt like a North Star pulling me. A ton of people do this! It‚Äôs difficult but definitely possible. Good luck! I started mine during work hours (and before and after). I'm in the same boat right and I'm trying to find that time and energy to push through but I have faith i will make it happen. Good luck I run a financial brokerage full time now but before I was working my full time job as well! It‚Äôs definitely possible. My part time income actually started to surpass my full time income.

You can do this all you gotta do is lock in If you have to, you have to.  But it really isn't ideal, and I would try to find another way around it if you can.  For me, I sold my house and moved my family of 4 into the room above my parent's garage.  My wife and I quit our jobs the same day, we lived poor for the first year so that we could dedicate 100% of our time to the new business.  Again, you have to do what you have to do, so I'm not saying anyone has done anything wrong.

My issue with trying to work full time while starting a business is that it's a loss of trajectory.  Starting a business requires time and effort, and if you're trying to ""serve 2 masters"" (your current job and your new business) it's going to get difficult.  As an example, imagine that your customers double every year, and let's say you can currently give your business 10 hours per week.   If you get 3 customers this year, next year is 6, then 12, 24, and 48.  So by year 5 you'll have 48.  If you can go 100% on your new business in the beginning, and give it 40 hours per week (4 times as much), then you'll have 12 customers this year.  Which means then 24, 48, 96, and 192.  So 5 years from now, you can have 48 customers, or you can have 192, and it's all dependent on what you did in your first year.

While that's clearly a completely made up scenario and overly simplified, something along those lines is what happens.  Where your business is at in 5-10 years is very dependent on how fast you can achieve growth in your first year.  I think businesses often fail before they ever get going for this very reason.  The owners could never give it the time it needed to get it growing fast enough to earn enough money to leave their day job. totally possible, but it‚Äôs all about disciplined time management. could you dedicate a set block of hours‚Äîlike early mornings or evenings‚Äîto work on your business consistently?

btw, there‚Äôs a newsletter called AI the Boring that focuses on practical strategies and tools to streamline workflows and save time, especially for side hustlers. might be a great resource to help you optimize and scale while juggling a full-time job! It will be slower results but possible. You should easily be able to squeeze 2.5 hours+ a day out for the business during the week. 

1 Hour Morning

0.5 Hours Lunch

1 Hour Evening

If you're excited about it you'll start to find even more time to squeeze it in. I would focus on outsourcing some stuff. Just make sure you get good quality work done by the other person. This is how you‚Äôre meant to do it. 

Until the side business starts making more money than your full-time job/what you need to live, and the revenue is sustainable.

Ease in and out of each scenario slowly but surely. In some salary jobs, as long as you get the tasks done, they don't really nitpick what you do. I am able to maintain my job duties throughout the day when needed, and make progress toward my online business on a laptop in between. I‚Äôm doing it now. It‚Äôs a lot of hard word but it‚Äôs fun. Eventually I‚Äôll have to choose between the two I think Yes you can - it's tough and a lot of hard work + sacrifice but it's doable i think you need to be very realistic with the amount of time you can dedicate to this. just put in your nights and weekends Option 1. Do nothing. It‚Äôs too hard. It‚Äôll take forever. Why try?

Option 2. Do something. It‚Äôs not easy. 5-10 hours a week is 1-3 months of progress over the course of a year. That‚Äôs 100% more effort than nearly everyone. Next year will be that much closer. I only fail if I stop trying. It‚Äôs possible, but like others said, you have to be ruthless with your time. If you only have a few hours per week, focus on the essential tasks. Do the things that will move the needle most for your business. I did it, I was working as a nurse for many years burnt out with the profession wanted something else I chose Nutrition as a side hustle business, there are other very successful businesses out there. Connect with peers or mentors in the area it took me 2 And a half years to replace my income before I walked away from my profession. Totally doable. I have both. I built my business (Talking Tree) to deal with inefficiencies at my day job (5AM to midnight was not sustainable). It worked well enough that I now spend less time doing both than I spent previously on my day job. I worked 80-95 hour weeks.  If you want it you will make it happen.  First year $7k.  Last year $900k.  I still work 50 hour weeks to be fully transparent. An online business is very realistic to start up while working fulltime if you have the motivation and drive to do so.  I would say that‚Äôs actually the smartest time to start.  

If energy is low maybe you just need to be a little more excited about it.  Try finding some other entrepreneurs at a similar stage to build connections with and/or join an A2Z type challenge to help keep you motivated and on track. I‚Äôm currently doing this however my job is 7 days on 7 days off regardless it is a lot of hard work to get something off the ground while working full time If you‚Äôre prepared to work around the full time job then it‚Äôs 100% realistic and possible. 

Think about the processes and what you can automate. I started a making websites in college that went decent for a college kid, but not decent enough for me to commit to it full time. Ultimately, it depends on your priorities‚Äîworking a 9-to-5 and then a 6-to-10 side hustle doesn‚Äôt leave much room for anything else and you‚Äôre not giving 100% to either your startup or your paying job.. One big lesson I learned afterward is the power of delegation. Back in college, I made the websites myself: finding clients, designing the sites, and handling everything on my own. Although I don‚Äôt build as many websites these days, I delegate the actual development work, and that frees me up to focus on other aspects. I may not take as much of the pie home as much per project, but the extra time I gain is invaluable. It‚Äôs definitely something to think about. I did it but it took about 10 years to get there. I‚Äôd say the biggest thing is consistency. The day job could leave you energized or completely drained depending on what‚Äôs happening in the company. As long as you do a little bit every day, you‚Äôll get there eventually. Some weeks will be better than others and life WILL get in the way. Stay determined and you‚Äôll get there. I did this for 3 years until I was laid off then went full time in my business. I worked 10 - 20 extra hours a week (nights and weekends) doing design work for clients. On average was making $30k a year on the side. Then the first year I went full time I made $160k+. It was exhausting and I had to miss some social events but still lived a fulfilling life during this time. But it feels great to have my weekends and nights back since I can get so much more done during the day. 

Depending on what you‚Äôre trying to do, you only have so much time and energy on the side so you‚Äôll be limited in results. But it‚Äôs a great way to build a base, get your clients/users established until you feel ready to go full time. I also only lived off my full time job and didn‚Äôt touch the side income - just saved it for the day I went full time. If you're planning on building an online business then you should continue with your job and outsource the building stuff for example website etc to others and dedicate your weekends on learning on how to sell in the online world. You can spend outsourcing money from your job while focusing on the more important aspect of a business. Alot of people have good ideas but they're marketing skills are very poor which is why they don't succeed in a stable business. They might shut down after 6 months or the first year. This way you might not burn yourself out while achieving your goal You can definitely. Depends how bad you want it. it's possible, but it can lead you to burnout. 

I have a lot of stories about when my friends and I did it and the end is every time the same - burnout, stress, and quitting. But I believe it's possible if you can find the balance for your mental health I did it. I worked toward my goal for 3 years. Then I set up the business and worked both jobs for a year. Then I went off on my own. I am on my third year solo. 

It can be done, but it‚Äôs not easy. You have to commit and be hungry and treat it like it‚Äôs your only lifeline. Not a side hustle. Otherwise you won‚Äôt succeed when it is your only lifeline. The strength is to have a steady income that you can dedicate to the business monthly. You are going to outsource more of the tasks. I do it everyday! Thanks everyone ‚ò∫.  I'm starting right now, today,  in the weekend. As for during the week, I will allocate 1-2 hours per day. 

in total around 25 hours a week, more than enough to start something. I can totally relate to your struggle - building a business while working full-time is incredibly challenging but absolutely possible with dedication and the right approach. If you're looking for strategies to maximize your limited time and energy, I've found the book ""Deep Work"" by Cal Newport to be really helpful for improving focus and productivity. Can be really tiring to do this especially if your a one-person business but it is also good to take advantage that you have an 8 to 5 which will give you a consistent income until you get your business moving and earn more than what you're earning in your 8-5. it's possible but you'll sacrifice some rest and sleep So this was honestly not the most healthy time of my life but yes it is possible to start your own business while working full time.

I worked at a start up building websites for around 45hr per week. At night and in the weekends I worked on my business. 

I guess if you really want to have that entrepreneur life you have to go trough that for a while Cfbr I tried before work but it was too tough, I was tired during work. I can find time in the weekends though, if that's enough are you able to find time in the morning or the evening?  currently I want to start in the weekends only Hey there! Let me break down Bizzed AI's potential using our frameworks - I've dug deep into this one and have some interesting insights to share.

SOWS Analysis:

* Stale (No): You've got to love this - they're actually innovating in the AI automation space, not just riding old tech.
* Old (No): They're the new kid on the block, which has its pros and cons. Think startup energy with that fresh perspective.
* Weak (Yes): Here's where it gets interesting - they're up against some big players like UiPath, but they've smartly carved out their own niche in the SME market.
* Simple (Yes): Their business model is beautifully straightforward - AI-powered automation tools on a subscription basis. Clean and clear.

BRIT Analysis:

* Buy (Yes): The numbers are looking sweet - 65% margins on subscriptions and positive cash flow? That's the kind of financial health you want to see.
* Resist (Yes): Here's the thing - business automation is becoming more of a necessity than a luxury. Even in tough times, companies need to optimize operations.
* Increase (Yes): There's definitely room to grow here. They could expand their service offerings, tap into new markets, or even raise prices as they build their brand.
* Tech (Yes): This is their playground! They're already tech-forward, but there's always room to enhance their AI capabilities or add new features.

From where I'm sitting, Bizzed AI checks a lot of boxes. Their 200% revenue growth in 18 months isn't just a number - it's a sign they're solving real problems for their customers. But here's the kicker - you've got to keep an eye on those big competitors. They might be in a different niche now, but markets change fast in tech.

What I really like is their focus on SMEs - it's like finding a gold mine that the big players overlooked. Plus, with those margins and positive cash flow, they're not just growing, they're growing sustainably.

But remember, you've got to proceed with caution. The tech space moves fast, and while they're innovative now, they'll need to keep that momentum going to stay competitive. Have you thought about their R&D pipeline or their customer retention rates? These could be crucial factors for long-term success. I used Bizzed AI - Find & Buy Your Perfect Business thanks for the advice thanks If you don‚Äôt mind me asking. How did manage to get clients for your business and communicated with them while doing your job? OK.  I will start working on it in the weekends great advice,  thanks Yes you can do this working only weekends. 

It will take a set but unknown amount of hours. If you only do it on the weekends it will take longer. Typically in the evening, my mornings are too busy and I'm a grump the entire day if I get up at 5am. Do what works for you and your schedule.",2025-01-16 14:28:05

Starting my online business felt impossible every post flopped, every strategy failed, and the self-doubt was loud asf. I kept wondering, ‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm just not cut out for this?‚Äù

But I decided to stick it out. I focused on showing up every day, even when it felt like nothing was working. Slowly, things started to shift. Now I‚Äôve built a business I‚Äôm proud of and it‚Äôs growing every single day.

Congratulations, please give me some practical advice. Great story. Appreciate that Hey OP, glad to hear you stuck it out and it paid off!

What would you say were the main contributing factors to the shift, that changed the outlook of the business?

Would love to hear how you turned it around. I feel you on that struggle!¬†But peep this - you stuck it out like a boss! That persistence is straight fire. You was out here showin' up every day, even when it felt like you was screamin' into the void. That's that real entrepreneur energy right there. Sounds good glad it's working for you yeah I'm just sitting here right now ready to give up sick of it. Trying to raise capital for a nationwide business and some inventions and it's just running into brick walls no matter what I do What business should I start actually in the online space, I have no clue How do you start building your business (making it known to clients) 

I am currently working on my online business but I am struggling as to where to start. Any advice would be greatly appreciated? Awesome!!! Really needed to hear it, feeling stuck. 2 years on it, finding it hard to launch for one reason or the other. How did you navigate through your phase of self-doubt while dealing with all the external noise? SAY THIS LOUDER!! [deleted] Yeaaa dude it defs sound like a robot OP did. It was showing up, consistency. Doing even a small thing, but doing it every day. Guaranteed to bring results. Thanks for asking! If I had to pinpoint one turning point, it would be when I stopped obsessing over perfection and just focused on showing up consistently. I realized that waiting for the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù post, strategy, or timing was holding me back. Once I leaned into the idea that progress > perfection and started taking messy action every day, things began to shift. That mindset change matters!!!! How about u? R you on a similar journey, or just starting out? Thank you! I focus on helping people grow their business through social media accounts!

As for what didn‚Äôt work: Posting without a niche, chasing trends instead of being authentic and overthinking creating content instead of keeping it real.

Once I stuck to being consistent and relatable, everything changed! A marketing business through social media üôåüèΩ But Print-On-Demand on websites like Etsy is oversaturated becuz there is too much competition. But focusing on a less competition niche can take you far ahead. Good Luck! Omg digital print on etsy is üî•üî• I‚Äôm looking to get into that soon. And hmm do u have a maketing strategy in place? You got this man!! Just stay consistent and show up for ur business Fair question! When I first started, I was focused on learning as much as I could, so I used strategies and shared what was working for me as I tested and applied them obviously failed a lot. As I kept showing up I started to see growth and I know people are going through the same thing I went through so I just wanted to help them grow their business the way I grew mine

We all start somewhere, and honestly sharing the process as I went helped me learn even faster! Does that make sense? Yess a shift in mindset is completely important!! You got this! Of course!! My actionable steps mainly focuses on Instagram and how to monetize it! The free guide is on my beacons for free if you want to grab it >Thank you!

You're welcome! Thanks, I appreciate that! The biggest shift came from focusing on consistency and connection. I stopped overthinking and just showed up daily posting, engaging, and starting genuine conversations.

I also narrowed my focus, targeting a specific audience instead of trying to appeal to everyone. That‚Äôs when things started to click, and people began resonating with üôåüèΩüôåüèΩ And the fact that I have a 9-5 the hustle is very real!! Thank you so much for the kind words üò≠üôåüèΩ Change your mindset!!! You can do it! Have you looked into different strategies? I‚Äôm not familiar with ur business model but sometimes there are different strategies to implement if u know Wasn‚Äôt all that hard to catch Yes!! Exactly üôåüèΩü§ùüèΩü•Ç Totally answered their question. Wow that‚Äôs a great mindset that can be applied to a lot of areas in life :) Social Media Marketing thingy I guess I'll do it ASAP. Thank you for the insightful reply, that was exactly what I was looking for. Just need to knuckle down and keep going after it, honing the focus of the business through the desired audience.

Wish you all the best on the rest of your journey and look forward to seeing the success story unfold here. How did you figure out the specific audience you wanted to target? I'm having a hard time figuring that out. And congrats on your success, love to see that! Consistency is what does it for me too. And I learned that it doesn‚Äôt matter if you have a day full of closed deals, new leads, conversion rates and you checked off your entire week‚Äôs newsletter, and then another day when you do just a brief internal brainstorm in the shower. It‚Äôs showing up. Shit my bad this was for another question üòÇ Thanks so much!!! Yeah I gotchu!! So based on your business you need to find out HOW you can help a specific target audience. So for example: if your audience wants to grow their business, start posting content about how YOU can help them grow their business. This allows the algorithm to push ur content to ppl who actually needs help. So u just gotta train the algorithm to ur favour Ahh thank you so much! Showing up brings you closer to the results you‚Äôre looking for! Thank you!!!

I‚Äôm working on a social media business idea and need your brutally honest feedback ‚Äì no sugarcoating.

The idea: Book social media services like a product ‚Äì no agency required.

Fixed prices, transparent offers, no long-term contracts.

Instead of expensive agencies or unreliable freelancers, you pick clear service packages that are instantly bookable.

Why?  
Agencies are frustrating. Anyone who has run a business knows the drill: ‚ÄúHey, we‚Äôre a social media agency and we can help you grow on Instagram!‚Äù ‚Äì followed by cold calls, overpriced retainers, and unrealistic promises.

I want to do things differently:

* No subscription, no long-term commitments
* Clear packages with fixed pricing
* Book it like a product ‚Äì no sales calls, no pushy emails

Example Packages:

* Social Media Starter Kit ($299) ‚Üí 5 post designs + 3 text templates for Instagram & LinkedIn
* Reels & Shorts Package ($799) ‚Üí 3 short-form social media videos with editing & music
* Ad Setup Package ($999) ‚Üí Targeting analysis + campaign setup for Meta or LinkedIn
* Consultation Package ($199) ‚Üí Ideas & strategy tailored to your business for effective social media

What‚Äôs the Consultation Package?  
Many small businesses have no idea what to post on social media.

What kind of content works for my industry?

Should I do Reels, ads, or community-building?

Is social media even worth it for my business?

This package helps businesses figure that out ‚Äì without paying thousands for an agency.

A few questions for you:

1. Would you or someone you know use a service like this? Why or why not?
2. Are you as fed up with the social media agency model as I am?
3. Do platforms like this already exist? Have you used them?
4. What concerns would you have about this model?

Looking forward to your honest feedback. Constructive criticism is more than welcome.","I did social media marketing for a few years in China, so similar work but different market. My perspective may be off the mark, but I can‚Äôt imagine businesses paying those prices for those services. What returns are they going to get on their investments? How are you going to convince them?
From my experience, clients want to see metrics. 
Show them past results. 
For your Reels & Shorts package, that works out to about $267 per video. Why would a small business be paying you that much for a short video? (Likely under 3 minutes, works out to about $100/minute.)

How will your expertise be better than them asking ChatGPT for the AI equivalent of your Consultation Package? 

Not trying to discourage you, just trying to give you some things to think about. 
Wishing you success and joy. Thats basically what fiverr or upwork is right. And I have been reselling fiverr packages to customers since the day fiverr started (2010). 
  
It was amazing when you could get video clips by real speakers for $5 lol I would just throw in 10 videos for clients for free and they absolutely loved it. now you pay a lot more some want 300‚Ç¨ and its just 3 month use haha",2025-01-16 11:47:18

I‚Äôm in the early stages of starting a furniture business and could really use some guidance.

I plan to attend trade shows stay on top of industry trends and build connections with suppliers and manufacturers. While I‚Äôm excited about entering this space, I have a few questions and would love to hear your advice:

**1. Marketing Strategies**

\- For someone starting out, what are the most effective ways to market furniture locally and online?

\- Would you recommend building a full website first, or can I start with platforms like Instagram and local word-of-mouth?

**2. Product Line**

\- Should I focus on launching with one signature product to test the waters, or is it better to start with a small collection (e.g., 3‚Äì5 items)?

\- For those who‚Äôve been in this industry, what types of furniture (e.g., chairs, tables, shelves) have you seen perform best in the early stages?

**3. Sales Channels**

\- I‚Äôm considering starting locally by selling to friends, family, and at markets, and then expanding online.

\- How would you recommend balancing local and online sales in the beginning?

**4. Long Term Growth**

\- What are some key things to focus on early to build a reputation for quality and trustworthiness?

\- How can I ensure I‚Äôm scaling sustainably without spreading myself too thin?

I‚Äôd really appreciate any tips, personal experiences, or recommendations for resources that could help me as I navigate this journey.

Thanks so much for reading‚ÄîI‚Äôm looking forward to learning from you all!","Hi there, this sounds exciting! We've put together some tips for you below:  
  
**Marketing** \- Start with platforms like Instagram or Facebook and local word of mouth to get your products out there, it‚Äôs cost effective and great for building early interest. A website will also be valuable. Make sure to take high-quality photos and videos to highlight your craftsmanship. You can join local Facebook groups as well to show your products and network with your target audience.  
  
**Product Line -** Launching with one signature product is a smart way to test the market and get your brand noticed. If you have the resources, a small collection (3‚Äì5 items) can offer variety without overextending. Think about the most in demand pieces... maybe dining tables or shelves?  
  
**Sales Channels -** Selling locally first is a great way to build trust and gather feedback. Expanding online later can add to you your local sales once you‚Äôve fine tuned your offerings.   
  
**Long-Term Growth -** Quality customer service will be key here to build trust and your reputation. Collecting testimonials early can help you build that credibility. When it's time to scale, streamline operations by sticking to what works, and don‚Äôt hesitate to outsource tasks when needed.

Wishing you the best! I think it's better to start with marketing. You can use platforms like Instagram or Facebook to engage with your local community while you develop a website. Implement word-of-mouth marketing by networking within your community, participating in events, and forming partnerships with related businesses. Everywhere starts with an online presence. Websites are the most important thing along with word of mouth. Word of mouth is really difficult though at times so I‚Äôm curious to see what other people think I have a book or two on marketing woodworking businesses. I'd buy some books like that and read them.

Chair styles vary but if you've never built chairs you don't know what you are getting into. 

Shipping furniture can be costly, packaging complex and damage can be a factor. Marketing is very important early on, get yourself out there! It doesn‚Äôt have to be perfectly crafted content or anything, just make posts and get known! thanks so much!! i agree, i figured that it word of mouth would be best as I do live in NYC and it does seem like everyone is connected through mutuals thank you, i now have things to take into consideration. regarding the styles, wouldnt you say that it's something I can learn as my journey continues? Understood, i just need to put myself out there and learn as i go on Oh, man.  Woodworking is really complicated.  It's possible to build a business making simple furniture but some styles are really tricky to execute.   I don't know where your skills are and the sort of equipment you have so it's hard to say what would be within your production capacity.  When I was doing it I mostly did custom cabinets and built-ins with occassional furniture pieces.  If you're committed to doing furniture it's probably a tougher road than cabinetry. I was thinking about out sourcing my manufacturing. In the future i do plan on working with designers and manufacturers to create unique pieces but the items i hope to manufacture arent insanely detailed (design wise).

I'd like to hear some success stories about how that happened. What problem did you face and discover a niche for. What were you doing when you realized that was what your business was going to be?

If you don't want to disclose what your business does then could you at least say how you came across the problem, were you actively looking ect?

I'm just struggling to put together ideas and I'm looking for some form of inspiration. ","Do something you love.

‚ÄúI sold my business for $250K‚Äù *FUCK YOU!*

‚ÄúI launched my product on Product Hunt and got thousands of paying users‚Äù *SHUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH AND‚Ä¶ FUCK YOU!*

The internet is flooded with posts, videos, and people making it all look easy. Hate to break it to you, but believing that shit is like believing in Santa Claus. And if you‚Äôre dead sure I‚Äôm wrong, then *FUCK YOU TOO!*

Alright, alright‚Ä¶ now that I‚Äôve let my anger out, let me be real for a second. I used to be one of them. I believed in that dream. I thought it was easy, just take my dumbass idea, write some code, do a bit of marketing here and there, and boom, my bank account would jump from $0 to $100K overnight.

But that‚Äôs pure bullshit! The truth is‚Ä¶no one gives a fuck.

No one gives a fuck about your code.

No one gives a fuck about your logo.

No one gives a fuck about your idea.

No one gives a fuck about what you‚Äôre doing or your fucking story.

People are selfish. They‚Äôll only care if you‚Äôre giving them something that improves their life, not yours.

So fuck your shitty ideas. Fuck the money. Ask yourself this:

**Why the fuck am I doing this?**

*Is it for money?* There are easier and faster ways to make money.

*Is it for passion?* Then don‚Äôt expect people to give a shit about what you do.

*Is it because you‚Äôre chasing a dream?* Then get ready. You‚Äôre diving into a long, shitty sea that‚Äôll probably drag you down. But maybe, if you‚Äôre good *and* lucky enough, you‚Äôll stay afloat.

Like I said, **‚ÄúChasing dreams is like swimming through shit‚Äù** and I believe that with my whole damn chest. But now that I see things clearly, I‚Äôm ready for one hell of a shitty swim. So wish me luck, I better not fucking drown!

That's the entire point of business though? What kind of businesses have you tried? Maybe your issue is in the product or the methodology or the marketing.¬† Agree. People don‚Äôt give a fuck. You have to actually add value. Give the people what they want. 

Although it‚Äôs still possible if you get good at networking and sales and have a good product. 

PS I built a biz to $1M in sales in 3 years. So fuck you. Wasn‚Äôt easy but also wasn‚Äôt impossibly hard. Who hurt you? None of the people making money are lucky with some dumbass idea, writing some code, and a bit of marketing. They just executed like crazy while you weren't watching.

Edit, to answer your question--

>**Why the fuck am I doing this?**

Personally to create something that fixes the problem of people like me who have that problem. It's really THAT simple. Most successful businesses don't fall into any of your 3 categories of ""for money"", ""for passion"", or ""to chase a dream"", they fix a problem for people who have that problem and want it fixed. And it has been working so far for me so...I guess fuck you? luck isn't real, people say you get lucky but forget you invested so much time, energy and money to make it work. Don't rely on luck, outwork everyone and get paid Welcome to the grown up world where you find the number 1 rule: People are selfish! Number 2; Built something that adds value to another and you WILL earn money.

Start doing it only if it is your passion (or bucket list) and try to make money with it. If not, at least you liked what you did. 

Too many people burnt out because of only $$ but how you can manage that if you do not have any passion and continue to struggle after months and months of work It‚Äôs a good % of luck that your ‚Äúpassion‚Äù is something that is monetizable or underrepresented and/or needed. The other 95% is persistent forward motion. Just executing on a plan. People get tied up in the analysis phase, constantly trying to validate and overthink it. Thinking they need a MacBook Pro M4 because it‚Äôs faster and other nonsense. 

It does come down to having a semi-decent, maybe unique, idea, and then executing fully on it to completion. That is the rarity of success. i approve this message.. I believe in order to be successful, you should be willing to fail.

I failed many times before finally doing things right. I‚Äôve been homeless twice, made significant money only to lose it all a couple of times. Launched and failed multiple companies.

I didn‚Äôt get any kind of support from family, friends or relatives. In fact they all advised me against starting another company, everyone in my close circle is risk-averse. 

Currently have a company that‚Äôs doing very well.

Try, fail, learn, repeat. Some people might get ‚Äúlucky‚Äù and immediately get things right, but if you are willing to fail, learn and try again, it‚Äôs not a matter of luck, it‚Äôs a matter of time. Also it‚Äôs important to learn to communicate the value effectively.  If you can‚Äôt explain it, they won‚Äôt get it Comparison is a killer of joy. Just do you and don‚Äôt look at anyone else. Add value, results will follow... If easy is your expectation then difficulties feel unfair. Life is hard. Expect it. Don't seek easy if you want to be a business owner. Honestly so hard I try to tell everyone it's gonna cost you more time, money, stress, and relationships than you can ever plan for ahead of time. Wishing you all the best .. start small and keep showing up everyday..

The journey doesn't have to be lonely. I have an unbelievable amount of people that offer their support and services for me to achieve success and in turn I would do the same for free to those I care about. 1. You say fuck a lot.  I'll take that to assume you're not an overly religious one, but maybe you are they aren't necessarily mutually exclusive.  What you call luck, the religious ones call doing what God has called them to do. If you're doing what God wants you to do, you'll be successful.  For the nonreligious, call it luck.  Whatever it is, you're right, you better have it. 

2. Santa Claus is real, where do you think your presents came from as a child?  

3. You are correct that no one cares about you.  Your mother is possibly the closest person to actually caring about you. Beyond that, no one.  It' an important concept to understand.  You want people to be good deep down, they're not. They will always do what's in their best interest with the exception of a small, rather meaningless things. People will give a homeless guy a buck or two because it makes them feel good, and deep down they won't really notice that buck or two is missing. 

4.  Many businesses are successful.  Many are not, and they're out of business.  So the businesses you see that are still in business are likely successful.  There are plenty of examples of success in your every day life. 

5. People start businesses for different reasons.  I wanted autonomy.  Along the way, I figured out how to make a lot more than I was making working for someone else.  But that wasn't the driving factor. I committed to starting my own business when my boss told me I couldn't have Saturday off... Saturday was my son's 5th birthday party.  I asked for it 3 months in advance.  6 months later my business was running and I was out. All the best for you right there with love and spend like a billionaire with lots of love for you and to the moon and back¬† [removed] Why should anyone care? They won't if you haven't given them a reason to.

But yes re the shit. Good insight that you are giving. Although I highly recommend you reading the book ""The magical power of thinking Big"". I would change your perspective on things mate. But what did this teach you about inside sales? The secret to being an entrepreneur is be born to a rich family. That's your problem. Not our fault you cant have a crack a success over and over until you succeed on mom and dad's money. This is a strange amount of hubris for someone who seems to just be starting out... lol reality As someone who quit my stable job 2 years ago and now run my own business I completely agree.

It‚Äôs the mental equivalent of crawling through shit. 

It‚Äôll be harder than you expect and it‚Äôll take longer than you expect. 

It also highlighted more than ever to me how every bit of content you see online, every YouTube video, emails you receive, ads you get, every time someone offers to give you a free ebook. 

Behind it all the story is always the same.

Fuck you! That's my name!¬† ‚ÄúWhy are you doing this?‚Äù Important to ask yourself this everyday. Maybe there is a market opportunity to profit from the hate of other people. step 1 is have an idea people give a fuck about. if you can't make an investor have a ""holy shit"" moment, it's wraps from the rip. I fell like launching a business is like releasing your own song to the public. If it does not connect with people in some way, it won‚Äôt sell. Thanks for the reality check. So fucking true. I get up my ass. First I do what‚Äôs necessary to get the ball rolling and paying bills. Then I make fucking cold calls. Then cold emails. The following up. Then social media. Then SEO. Then I actually work on my service. Add meetings, I‚Äôm fucked I mean at least it‚Äôs not written by AI This is untrue and the last sentence sums it up well, you are just another guy who wants to start one day but already have tons of opinions that you label the truth. Wait‚Ä¶.is there no Santa Clause? lol well that's motivating Yeah what are the easier faster ways of making money? What is the field in which you are primarily interested to start a startup? Then you start enjoying swimming in shit Considering how much traction this post got you might have a shot at the content creation aspect of whatever it is you decide to do. Good luck bro! Don‚Äôt forget the people on this thread lol name some easier and faster ways to make money aside from trivial shit like inheritance or lottery From my experience you have got it pretty bang on. I was chasing something trying to get that ""Better Life"" didn't quite plan out for me either. But it was important to go through because it helped me find what I am actually passionate about. Now I'm quite happy to work a shitty job as long as I can go home and improve my skills and build my projects. And who knows maybe one day it will bring some cash my way.  But honestly I couldn't give two shits whether it does or doesn't. I'm just fucking tired of not seeing any results of my work. 0 mrr. 0 social virws. 0 blog post views. I don't have a budget. I have a little SaaS that so far has cost me so much time! In fact - 8 failed saas projects that have made a grand total of... 0! You say people are selfish‚Ä¶ are you? Cause you seem very focused on your own success I can never tell if these things are serious. He's saying he has no reason to build a startup except its on a wish list... ""I thought it was easy"". Who told you that ? ""take my dumbass idea, write some code, do a bit of marketing here and there, and boom, my bank account would jump from $0 to $100K overnight."". You have (or you had) a really skewed perception of reality ... But now you are better armed for your next try Top tier shitpost rebuttal to the scam shitposts that flood this sub. How much did you loose on your first business to say that ? 100%,There is money in any industry but the easier ones are the ones where you solve a problem....that dropshipping store ain't gonna work unless a very small niche community for some reason sees a cheap piece of chinese plastic as valuable then sure.

But most guys should probably take a walk around their block see if everyones lawns are mowed,driveways are pressurewashed and curbs are painted....if not....offer it as a service.

Feel how door to door sales feels.

Don't offer things like marketing unless you have experience or have a degree....because otherwise you are scamming small companies Who cares ? What they do isn‚Äôt going to impact you if you can pivot and adapt. If you can‚Äôt then fuck you too Nais post, thanks for spilling the truth Stopped reading at the first fuck you Why don‚Äôt you just start an online business? Drop shipping is super easy and makes a lot of money. I can mentor you. /s And your welcome on my watch I really wasn‚Äôt worried not funny Hal fenny please seek therapy Wow a new fuck you post, so original /s 
To me you just sounds jealous and insecure. Have a nice day. And fuck you too. Please, lay off the cocaine. Hopefully not being a motivational speaker or doing a ted talk. Never you mind that remains to be seen¬† Do you really want to know? ahaha When I make my first million, I‚Äôm reinvesting it and getting back to work.

Hows that? You are absolutely right. But at the beginning and without any experience, it is something that is not immediately clear to you. Definitely it was my mistake. I built a platform that solved a problem I had, thinking that it would be useful to others and that I could ask for money for it. What's profit margin tho what is your business? respect, you clearly know what you're talkin' about! 1M in 3 years?? that‚Äôs mad impressive, but also yeah, it‚Äôs all about that grind and actually adding value! üíØ I'm not saying it's not possible; if it were, I wouldn't keep trying. I'm just making it clear that the idealization that has been made of dreams in general is quite wrong, and for someone like me who is new to dreaming it can be a setback. BTW good luck for your BS Now I'm aware that's the point, but when you start out with no experience and focus on what they show you online, you don't see that point of view. So yes you are right, but when I started I didn't have the means to figure it out on my own. And now that I have a clearer idea I wanted to send a ‚Äúmessage‚Äù to those who maybe are in the same situation as I was in the beginning Hard work and perseverance are the keys, however, sometimes we have to be in the right place at the right time Luck actually plays a huge part in success. There is research to prove it. Obviously without the work nothing happens, but luck is a big part of the puzzle. 100% of posts on here are lying shills, struggling beggars and complete novices asking for a free unicorn. That is it bro. Eh kind of. I met this guy in Australia working on a laptop out of his $300,000 shed on brighten beach. He made millions from some school education software in the 90‚Äôs. His brother put way more hours on his own business and hasn‚Äôt got that lucky. Luck actually plays a huge part in success. There is research to prove it. Obviously without the work nothing happens, but luck is a big part of the puzzle. Any plan that requires luck is a bad plan. ""We make our own luck.""  
   \- Me I manage because providing a good life for my family and myself is what I'm passionate about. Running my business isn't my life. It's a means to an end.  It's a way to have the resources to live the life I want to live. Absolutely true Wise words dude \>>  Just executing on a plan.  
Absolutely. yup. me too. -- a founder trying to stay afloat We are on the same wave then Okey then I am well on my way hahah. BTW good luck buddy I totally agree with your concept.     
....but it's not failure:  It's a learning experience.    
  
for OP-Werewolf:    
\* Nelson Mandela said:  There's only two possible outcomes.  I will succeed - or I will learn.   
  
\* NASA & SpaceX both experience catastrophic launch failures.  But look at their language:  NASA calls an unplanned explosion a ""catastrophic launch failure.""  SpaceX calls it a ""Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly.""    
   =  You learn something.  You dust yourself off.  You move on.    

If you are not familiar with...   Teddy Roosevelt - The Man in the Arena   ...go Google that & read it.  Frame it & put it on your wall.  Internalize that concept & it will change your life.  

I believe we actually learn more from our 'failures' than from our 'successes'. Absolutely true Yeee, but is that really possible to do? Not always. You can add value with a product of your own. But it doesn't necessarily reach people immediately Nothing is easy. I'm aware of that now Sometimes you have to tell it like it is, don't you think? You win something but lose something else in return Thanks dude!! I'm glad to hear this Uhm, what?

Are  you having a stroke? Sometimes I am alone, sometimes I am not, but that is not the point 1. No I'm not religious, but I'm sorry I've used the word fuck so many times for times it's easier to get the message across that way.

2. So now why doesn't he come anymore?

3. I don't want to say that people suck, in the end when there is a problem we are part of it in 99% of the cases, but I want to say that for a person like me who didn't understand at first, and thought about solving his own problem, he has to understand that if he wants to solve his own probelma he has to solve other people's first otherwise you don't get anywhere

4. There are many true success stories, but in our industry it is very easy to interface with them online, and very often the story told is very different from the real one

5. You had a very good reason for doing it hahah thanks man, you cheered me up a lot with this comment Good point man. This is a more realistic way of telling it like it is The only reason to do that they will have and it will be to benefit them, I sound cynical, but I think it is the reality of the situation and I myself am part of the problem How it would change my perspective. Btw I added it to my books to read, thanks for the recommendation dude What do you mean? Do you really think that is the only way to be an entrepreneur? I disagree completely.  I know hundreds of successful entrepreneurs, and almost none match that profile.    
Most of the successful entrepreneurs I have met are downright scrappy:    
1) They were born poor & raised poor.    
2) Learned everything they could about running a small biz.    
3) And scaled it up:  You figure out quickly what you are doing right, and do more of that.  Figure out quickly what you are doing wrong, and do less of that.    
4) Even after a lot of hard work, they usually didn't succeed the first time, but learned from it & moved on.    
That's the winning profile. Why do you rep this arrogance? The important thing is to reach an awareness of how hard and difficult it will be What? Fuck you dude that's my name! always Yes!    
Werewolf:  please look up a TED Talk by:   Simon Sinek   
   Know your 'Why' I'm pretty sure there are already profitable organizations in that field It is not so obvious to have these kinds of ideas It is a kind of art nothing bro Absolutely screwed. But after all, it's what we chose for ourselves. ehmmm...thanks???hahah Explain yourself better Um...no...I mean yes...I can explain. So it has served some purpose Get a degree, and find a common job. If you already have a 9-5 then you shouldn't think about startups as a side-hustle, rather you should do freelance projects or something like that. You make a lot more money, faster and most importantly you take less risk Aside from the world of technology, two of the worlds that I feel belong to me the most are online resale of items and clothes (something I've made some money with in the past few years) and writing (I've always enjoyed writing and in one of those 100 things to do before I die I also included that of writing a book and publishing it, btw lately I've also started writing here on Reddit a few posts), so I've taken these things that I'm passionate about and created two SaaS related to these worlds mhhh... Thanks dude Degree-->Job I wish you to earn something with your projects and if it is not as you said, who cares, the important thing is that you are happy Were you able to figure out what the problems might have been? He is saying people only care about themselves, their problems, their job, their livelihood. Not whatever you are trying to sell them.

He isn‚Äôt saying they are bad, selfish people. They are human. If you want to reach, inspire and motivate them to buy put all the focus on them, their problems and how you might solve those problems. Maybe or maybe not People are 'selfish' in the sense that they are not going to become a customer just because you put a product/service out into the marketplace.  People will only part with their hard-earned money if you have an offering that will somehow benefit them.    
In the B2C world, that means save a consumer time, make them look good, satisfy their tastebuds or other cravings.    
In the B2B or B2G world, you save a business (or gov't agency) time, money, solve a problem for them, address a painpoint.    
Personally, I will never launch a B2C biz again.  I have had great success in the B2B and B2G worlds.    
But that's another topic for another time. Lol I think that without being selfish you can't achieve any bigger success. It's a joke man hahah, do you really think a person wastes his years doing something just because he wrote it on a list? Man it is the reality of what is shown online, if you have experience okey you can tell the true reality from what is just fiction, but people like me who had started from 0, got screwed. You're right though, now I'm armed for the future. I didn't lose money; I lost an ideal and time Mhh, you give me pause with these words. I don't know whether I agree with you or not, I need to think about it I'm glad you understood what I meant I'm sorry but reality also includes fuck ahh? I think his TED talk would be epic! Lmfao ü§£ made me laugh on the metro No, fortunately for you no, you can breathe a sigh of relief Yeah why not ! I mean your situation may definitely not be a lost cause. There could be so many factors that influence things. Hard to say without a proper analysis that was 4 years ago.   i don't run it anymore but i get \~$300k/yr of profit off it and then work a different job.  i hired a COO to run it 2 years ago.  i have to do 1-2 calls with them a week to coach them.  When I first hit $1M annual sales, profit was \~$150k.   edit: for clarity, i paid myself $150k salary THEN profit was $150k.  Margins on what we sold was \~55% then we had expenses that netted out to \~15% net income. b2b performance marketing services I agree with you.  This shit is overhyped.  And people think they will just stumble on something they can do from their laptop in their bedroom and make a million.  just doesn't happen that way.  the process i went through didn't look glamorous AT ALL.  it was a bunch of thankless work and my family thought i was ""lost without a job"" for 2 years!  Keep it going man.  I joke about the ""10 year overnight success"" -- once you hit it big people think it was 'fast' - and usually discount all the grinding that leads up to that success. You're aware that just because YOU had problems, doesn't mean everyone had them right? Because by telling everyone to fuck off, you're speaking volumes about yourself rather than the others. If other businesses made a few tens of thousands and you didn't, that means YOU made a mistake in execution and not them by showing online what they did. And if you read carefully, many of those posts are actually showcasing EXECUTION, rather than what money they made. exactly my point, being in the right place at the right time is a direct result of your efforts I hope not 100% Wow tell me more about this story That it requires ***only*** luck is a bad plan Then I wish you good luck dude :) There‚Äôs more than one way to skin a flute. chatgpt at home The point is that what you are saying is not correct and warrants some correction. The entrepreneur that says all the things that you said ""fuck you"" to. Yes, and those entrepreneurs don't say the things that OP said ""fuck you"" to. 

The entrepreneurs you're talking about, know how hard it is. They're a different breed. Unfortunately the kind of entrepreneur I was talking about is way too common. A bunch of people I went to highschool with, have heavy equipment rental services they started with capital from their parents, for most it was their second attempt at entrepreneurship, their first attempt was at something they were more passionate about, but also funded on parents dime.

If I was a parent and had stupid amounts of money I'd do the same for my kid. I believe anyone would and they do, that's why there are so many of those types of entrepreneurs. 

I'm not saying rags to riches stories don't exist, but let's be real they are not the majority of success stories. I'm not sure what you mean. Are you saying I represent arrogance?


I'm wondering why you're writing a personal pep rally against people's extremist marketing hooks. And saying entrepreneurship is like swimming through shit, when you don't seem to have any experience with it. I think it's goofy.


Now you're part of the group that has no idea what they're talking about, telling others who also have no idea what they're talking about. It's the most annoying part about entrepreneur culture, IMO. 


Why not just try it? Actually i think they are kind of obvious in the sense that the best ideas are the ‚Äúwhy is this not a thing yet‚Äù kind of ideas. I‚Äôm 24 and have secured angels for 2 startups because they‚Äôre either in an emerging market or disrupting an existing market with emerging tech. New possibilities, problems, and opportunities appear every day, and a lot of these old systems/ideas need reworking by new generations Im not super successful but im 23 and have took home 6figures 3 out of the 5 years since I‚Äôve been out of high school. I‚Äôve worked in sales, I run a small cleaning company and I used to sell pot as well. Running a business is def easier, less hours, more rewards than working a sales job or even a restaurant job. 

Selling pot takes the cake tho

That being said. It‚Äôs not necessarily swimming in shit. A lot of it is realizing you are worth more than you ever once thought before. A lot of it is liberating and dope Very well would follow you up. Keep learning and getting better. Best Wishes, Dude-  After I read your post above, I saw something jump out at me yesterday:  I was at Sams Club, and I saw an enclosed pallet that was marked ""Hold for Customer.""  I was intrigued, so I looked closer.  The whole pallet was a huge cardboard box full of new men's clothing - sold by Sams Club as a custom order to one customer.    
  FYI- Sams (and other bigbox retailers) will sell you a wholesale quantity of anything, for you to re-sell at retail prices.  You could actually have Sams or BJ's drop-ship the whole pallet directly to an Amazon warehouse, and then you market your Amazon 'store', with Amazon doing all the fulfillment.  I would rather buy a wholesale quantity of something from Sams Club than from some mystery Chinese supplier.    
  I don't know if this is the kind of biz model you are looking at.  
Let me know some details on your plans, and I think me & the community here could help you fine-tune your plans + results. I'm telling it like it is, and mind you I'm not saying that I'm different, in fact I'm just like everybody. BTW you are right the point is to focus on solving their/our problems and we will get the attention we want Honestly, I've read more idiotic things on this sub Fuck yeah fuck it fuck would fuck and fuck you too. ü§£ [Welcome to my TED Talk... now shut the fuck up.](https://youtu.be/rzuSKK-HOT8?si=CUEkgHdDmhg3Ncgg) wowwwwwwww 80% is composed of places in the world I would like to visit, I would like to live in NYC for at least 3 months, Overcome my fear of swimming and learn to serf.

How long did it take to get the experience or did you learn marketing stuff and just start doing it? I appreciate your honesty Regardless of what happens, it is always YOUR fault no matter what. If your business fails, it is YOUR fault. If you get a disease, it is YOUR fault because you have chosen a body with health problems.

Even if you succeed at something, it is because of YOU and not luck or any other circumstance, wealth or advantage. You are responsible for every desicion in your life. Maybe I am the problem, I am not ruling that out, however, seeing from the reaction of many, maybe not. Again, my argument is generalist, I am not attacking everyone who shows their success online or not, there are many figures I appreciate and follow, but my point is that most sell a dream (which is yes achievable) but is made to be seen as if it were a linear and easy path. That's all So we are saying the same thing, but expressing ourselves in different words Hope not! But I'd love to know the actual percentage though. Its difficult to believe half of what I read here.. That was pretty much it. He made a bunch because his software came out at the right time during the boom of the computer age around 1995 and all the schools across Australia adopted it. His brother still does pretty well though. I think he said he profits like ~$100k a year. But you know, not millions. Take any luck that comes your way but it shouldn‚Äôt be part of the plan. OK -   Yes, I hear ya.  As a parent & an entrepreneur, it's a fine line to walk, to put $$ into an adult child's business.  (""Just say no."")  I would be like:  Make a pitch to some other $$ source first, and let me know how that goes.   
 IMHO, the parent should provide guidance & connections, but never capital.  For so many reasons. No I simply wanted to ask you what you found arrogant in what I wrote, but you explained it to me.

I'm trying, but my message was not meant to be arrogant, I simply wanted to tell the old me, or those like me who are in the same situation as me, that achieving one's dreams is not ‚Äúall peaches and cream‚Äù something a beginner can easily believe. Tell me about your startups, maybe I can learn something I‚Äôm absolutely agreeing with you. I did a podcast episode entitled ‚ÄúNobody cares about you‚Äù Fuck yeah! Fuck Ted!  Uh, not literally.

We get sooooo much of our information from the internet. It‚Äôs really hard to wade through the believable ‚ÄúI did it and you can too!‚Äù crap online if you are a newb. You don‚Äôt know what you don‚Äôt know. Success is honed with experience. Other commenters are right, solve a problem and the money will follow. Just depends on how big of a problem it is and how good your fix is. If you solved a problem that isn‚Äôt a problem for anyone else, congratulations! You are your best and only customer. Now go and find out what others need solved and get to work. Yes YOU are the problem!

Give the people what they want. If they want pain, sell torture devices. If they hate others, provide them tools to make it easier for them to hate others.

If people need distractions, sell games, gambling or other stuff which causes addiction.

Actually the amount of problems people have are minimal nowadays as most is totally unneeded in the western world.

I tell you what children/young people need: A way to get rid of school bullies in school. Provide a solution and many will pay for it. (Founding a paramilitary organisation might go into the right direction.).

Solving a problem YOU have is already fine because there surely are others which have a similar problem.

Just wondering if there‚Äôs anybody here who‚Äôs regretted leaving a good, reasonably well-paying, challenging and fun job in order to pursue an entrepreneurial opportunity.

If you did/do regret, why, and what was your thought processes that ultimately made you go for it, even though expectations got frustrated?

Thanks in advance!","Nope.  I don't regret it.

I worked out that trying to do it as a side gig, (on weekends and evenings) it would take over 10 years just to get a working (and very good) prototype.

Quitting my 9 to 5, nice paying job was a necessity, not a nice to have.

Now the estimate is more like 6 months to 2 years instead of 10 years.

You HAVE to quit your job at some point. You‚Äôre not supposed to quit your day job when attempting to create a new business¬† Entrepreneurship has also become a societal pressure these days. Everyone wants to get into it. It's wrong to think about regret when you haven't even start doing it.  People most often regret not taking the risk at all and stay at where ever they were at the end of their lives.  I'm not advice you to take huge risks, but listen to your gut and bias towards action.   

Best of luck to you entrepreneurship adventure! Hey! I‚Äôve been there‚Äîleaving a good job for entrepreneurship is scary but exciting. I did it because I wanted to build something of my own, but it came with challenges like uncertainty and financial stress. Even when things didn‚Äôt go as planned, I don‚Äôt regret it because I learned so much. just wondering if someone had a regret when they did something? I mean...probably? You know what's awesome about your life? It's yours and you might have regrets but you get to do whatever you want. before you go into entreprenuership..ask yourself these questions : 1) am i knowlageable enough to enter into this business (skills,background,network of customers,marketing plan)? ..2) do you have plan b or plan c if the business does not work out as expected? ..3) do you have emergency funds in the first place to last you and your famillys living expenses for maybe 1 year? ..3) is your business sustainable (meaning not a fad that will go out of style in next few months)? ..4) is the business already saturated (red ocean ‚Äî means many are scrambling for customers that you are eating each others profit - fighting for lowest cost) ?..5) Exit plan or other souces of possible income.. It's totally depends on a lot of factors and it's unique.  
You need to find it for yourself. when you're starting a business, if it's possible, don't quit your job just yet. It's hard, yes, but it's the safest thing to do as it allows you to test the waters while you're figuring things out. Anyways, regret and failure are always part of the journey, it's just how you learn and grow. I wish I started some form of lead generation before taking the leap. Although, I dont regret doing it because I was at a time with low overheads and no children. 

It just would‚Äôve been easier if I had a form of lead gen set up like a YouTube channel or decent amount of social following and active email list. Or for local business a high ranking website for your niche and area (it takes like 6-12 months to rank p1). 

So my advice from 13 months in the trenches is to keep your job and spend 18-24 months getting some signals of interest in the form of followers and email list before jumping Not much tbh. Its gonna be hard for sometime. Be at it. You will bear the fruits someday Comfort never created anything great. I'm now comfortable in PRESSURE. Have to deliver. A majority do because a majority of businesses fail. Ignore anecdotal evidence on Reddit, and Google the actual facts. Easy. Never had a job in the first place. Only serious money I‚Äôve ever made was through my business. No golden handcuffs for me. When I left the military I tried to start a business instead of getting a regular 9-5. 10 months later I had burned through all my saving and taken on a significant amount of debt. It took years to recover from that failure. 
This time I am building my business the evenings after I clock out. Ya this. I got laid off in my first quarter of launch for the business but I am on that hunt for a new job and kept my second job that helps me seed the business expansion Depends when ur ready. Some of us have dabbled in business since we‚Äôve been about 12.

Wouldn‚Äôt advise quitting your job for your first ever business attempt

But if you think you can make it and need to go all in to make it happen, that‚Äôs what u gotta do This is way too broad of a statement to be for real.. It‚Äôs understandable.
Jobs, even highly skilled positions, often don‚Äôt provide anymore a comfortable life for you and your family.
Many people say ‚Äúyou know what? If I have to be miserable I may as well be miserable with a small chance to make it big‚Äù.

Make sure what you're offering is super clear, and the wording is simple, I messed that up the first time. I described it well enough but used fancy words and didn't explain what my real value prop","benefit, easy, recommend",,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i2k9jl/what_are_some_landing_page_mistakes_startups_and/,What are some landing page mistakes startups and business make that's hurting sales?,"Hi all- I am launching my product next week as a soloprenuer and I was curious, what are some landing page/website mistakes startups and business make that's hurting sales? :)","[deleted] Great question. Here are some mistakes I have been new founders make while launching for the first time

1. **Not charging enough:**¬†I often find founders sell $1 worth of good for 90 cents and think they have found product market fit. I would urge you to charge enough to make a good profit for each sale when you get started. This helps you really validate you are solving a real problem
2. **Complex messaging:**¬†I should be able to come to your website and figure out example what you are selling and why I should buy it within 15 seconds. If not, you are prob losing a lot of customers
3. **No activity:**¬† To increase trust, show activity. I recommend publishing blogs weekly on your website and also being active on social media that's linked on your website. You can easily automate this using AI tools like Frizerly as well! This will also help with SEO!
4. **Complex pricing:**¬†While just getting started, I suggest only having a single price option on the website to avoid decision fatigue

And that's about it! Here are some common rules to come up with **good** landing page (I've built a landing page builder and reviewed hundreds of pages):

‚Ä¢ **Keep messaging concise and clear**. Don't talk about ""you"", talk to your customer. Remove all words that you can remove. It forces you to speak boldly, which scares most of newbies, but that's what drives people interest.

‚Ä¢ **Explain outcome instead of explaining features**. Help your customer understand how your product fits in their daily routine. Don't make them think. Useful mental model is to think that your customer is in painful point ""A"" but your product will get them to the fruitful point ""Z"". Explain these two points in your messaging.

‚Ä¢ **Show, don't tell.** Include demos of your product all over the page. Always prefer visual to words. Human brain processes images crazy fast. Images show what your product actually does instead of vague describing through words. Words are super hard to get right.

‚Ä¢ **Include testimonials and social proof**. Even if you don't have testimonials on your product yet, you can use comments about your previous work related to your product. But be open about it. Testimonials are hard to get, but that's what driving sales. Include positions of people, so your users can associate them with your customer. Stars work great too to convince people. Never ever use fake testimonials.

‚Ä¢ **Simplify pricing**. Learn about psychological biases driving people decisions: eg. anchoring, hick's law, confirmation bias, narrow framing. Highlight desired plan and make your offer ""too stupid to say no"". Make it simple to understand. Make it simple for user to compare price and see the value of each plan (show percentage).  Analyse Pricing section (or page) a lot and refine over time. Pricing is a big topic overall, deserving its own research. Read ""$100M offers"" by Hormozi, it's a practical handbook on creating what he calls a ""killer offer"".

‚Ä¢ **Focus 1 call to action, don't overload page with dozens of buttons and links**. Include call to action multiple times in the page after key sections.

\--

**General Advice:** copy 10 great landing pages that sell (but comparable revenue, not huge companies). Copy section by section, word by word ‚Äî you'll see what is common between them, understand the general page structure and ""feel"" their copy style. Seriously, you'll become much better marketer just after this exercise.

Hope it helped! Mistakes we've seen are:  
  
Overloading the page with information or images that confuse visitors  
CTA not being clear or compelling i.e. visitors might not know what to do next  
A slow website that results in higher bounce rates  
Not adding testimonials, reviews, or guarantees  
Not making it clear to visitors what problem their product solves and why it‚Äôs worth their time. **#1 mistake:**

procrastinating and wasting time by tweaking and perfecting the landing page.

at the beginning, just showcase social proof, your solutions (not features) to a very specific problem, and make it super easy to buy. that's all customers really care about. when starting out, your time is best spent on marketing until you validate your idea and monetize it. otherwise you might be spending time on the wrong product. Adding on to all the good input everyone has, this is one that may contradict your question.  
""JUST PUBLISH IT FIRST, THEN UPDATE LATER""

I was in your position before a few years ago, but the decision fatigue and perfectionism syndrome hold me back to 1 month until I actually publish my business.  
That one month can lead to my first sale, or if there is some fatal mistake, at least exposure, and customer feedback. In my opinion, some of the mistakes are:

1. Too much information that confuses visitors, making it hard for them to find what they‚Äôre looking for.
2. A design that‚Äôs not responsive. Depending on your audience, if it‚Äôs not optimized, they‚Äôll just bounce off your landing page.
3. Bad visuals. It gives off a vibe of being unprofessional or untrustworthy.
4. Slow page speed. This frustrates users, and they‚Äôll definitely leave your landing page.
5. No social proof. If you don‚Äôt include this, you‚Äôre losing trust from potential customers.
6. Ignoring good UX. Poor UX frustrates users and decreases conversion rates.
7. Not clearly stating the benefits/value of your service/product. Visitors need to know exactly what they‚Äôll gain from your offering.
8. Not running A/B tests. A/B testing helps you understand what works and what doesn‚Äôt. To add to the good recommendations from others, make sure it has intuitive navigation, high quality product photos, maybe social media links to your pages there. Agreed with the other comments. Something I would add is not thinking about the consumer perspective. A lot of people like to overload information which can be overwhelming and take away from what‚Äôs important.  Something I personally did was have a few ideal clients walk through my website and their thoughts on it live on zoom for feedback. One common mistake I see a lot is having too much text or unclear messaging. Keep it simple, focus on your product's benefits in a catchy headline and use visuals to tell your story. Make sure your call to action is bold and easy to find! You can always edit a landing page. I'd recommend you get something out there first because miss #1 is only launching a perfect landing page instead of realizing your landing page is an MVP until you get enough traffic for it to matter 

Make sure what you're offering is super clear, and the wording is simple, I messed that up the first time. I described it well enough but used fancy words and didn't explain what my real value prop was in a digestible way to the user. Bullet points immediately saw a conversion lift in my case

Good SEO takes time, my personal market is helpful in that backlinks are commonly used in B2B and blogs are generally interacted with. That's probably not true of most sites. 

Right now the vast majority of my traffic is coming from social media or from businesses sponsoring my traffic on their site and recommending my product. 

My search engine customers are about 15-20% of customers currently Not clearly communicating what the product or service does and why it‚Äôs valuable. Visitors should immediately understand the value within 3-5 seconds of landing on your page Here is a good article about this: [https://www.natimarketing.com/product-landing-page-for-startups-how-to-create/](https://www.natimarketing.com/product-landing-page-for-startups-how-to-create/)

The main are:  
‚ùå¬†**Overwhelming Design** Keep it simple. Too many elements confuse the visitor.

‚ùå¬†**Weak CTAs** Avoid vague phrases like ‚ÄúLearn More.‚Äù Your CTA should make the next step obvious.

‚ùå¬†**Slow Page Load Times** 40% of visitors leave pages that take over 3 seconds to load. Use Google Search Console to identify and fix speed issues with compressed images, optimized code, and fast hosting.

‚ùå¬†**Failing to Meet Visitor Intent and Stage**  
Your messaging should align with where visitors are in the buyer‚Äôs journey and be coherent with the ads or entry points that brought them into the funnel.

‚ùå¬†**Skipping Mobile Optimization** Mobile-friendly design is non-negotiable, especially for startups targeting digital-savvy audiences.

In the article also you can find key blocks, tools and guidance. Hope you'll fond it useful ;) I actually just wrote a post about this earlier this week after browsing Product Hunt, i'll just copy and paste it here:

One of my favorite things about browsing Product Hunt is critiquing all of the terrible landing pages.

It's almost always:

‚ÄîToo much text.

‚ÄîVague offering (Can't tell what the product is solving).

‚ÄîVague copy (Who is this product for?)

‚ÄîVisuals that don't reinforce or showcase the product. (I recommend custom UI graphics that over-simplify your product specifically for the above the fold section, don't make visitors have to figure out how your product works in this section, serve it up on a silver platter.)

The above the fold of a landing page is one of the only areas of a website where you can literally just follow a simple repeatable format to convert visitors to customers, but most people just don't do it. The mistake of too much. Refine, reduce, and keep it simple. Remember that people scroll, not read. Make it skimable!! Lots of founders talk about the product. Dont. Talk about the problems. Your customer has. Also, build the site so that ads and social go to landing pages relevant to the ad or post. So organic traffic goes to home page, new visitors arrive to landing pages that are very specific and relevant to the preceding content Hi! Congrats on your upcoming launch‚Äîexciting times! üöÄ

When it comes to landing pages and websites, some common mistakes that can hurt sales include:

1. **Lack of a Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)** Make sure your CTA stands out and guides visitors toward the action you want them to take (e.g., ""Sign Up,"" ""Buy Now""). Avoid burying it or using vague language.
2. **Too Much Clutter** Overwhelming visitors with too much text, too many images, or unnecessary animations can drive them away. Simplicity and focus are key.
3. **Poor Mobile Optimization** A lot of users will access your site via mobile, so ensure it's responsive and loads quickly on smaller screens.
4. **Slow Load Times** Speed matters‚Äîa slow site can increase bounce rates. Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to test and optimize.
5. **No Social Proof** Reviews, testimonials, and trust badges (like ""secure checkout"") can help build trust with potential customers.
6. **Confusing Navigation** Visitors should easily find what they need without digging around. Keep navigation intuitive and streamlined.
7. **Weak Messaging** Make it immediately clear what your product does, who it‚Äôs for, and why it‚Äôs valuable. Avoid jargon and focus on the benefits.
8. **Missing Contact Information** If people can‚Äôt easily reach you, it may create doubt about your credibility. Include a contact form, email, or chat option.
9. **Overcomplicated Forms** If you require people to sign up or provide info, keep the forms short and simple. Too many fields can be a turnoff.
10. **Ignoring SEO Basics** Even for a landing page, optimizing titles, meta descriptions, and keywords can help drive organic traffic. karma Simplicity is key. Especially if you're selling a B2C product.

A general rule of thumb I like to use is picture a 3 year old on your website, The 3 year old should be able to guide himself to the checkout page with products in his cart. It should be that simple and straightforward. no clear CTA, spelling mistakes, sloppy design, website not responsive etc You should just take the same template as all website that works. If your landing page is different and the user need to find by themselve where to click, you will loose them easily. They need to feel in their zone 1. Websites that look sketchy - misspellings, buttons that don't work, coupons with the spinning wheel, no 'about me' or business info, or policies
2. Not having responsive UI - visitors will be from web, mobile, and all sorts of devices. Make sure it looks good across all platforms, especially the one where most users come from.
3. Not having user tracking - add something like Clarity to track user activity so that you can make informed changes
4. Bloat - Make things simple and easy to read so visitors can digest information. There shouldn't be any big walls of text In general, the value you offer needs to be crystal clear in the first .5 seconds.  If you make them work to understand they will bounce. 

Here are some other common errors: 

1. Talking about features in H1 and hero, and not benefits. You need to focus on what they get.  You solve the pain they have.  

  
2. Not speaking directly to one ICP - Define who your target is so you can speak directly to them.

  
3. Writing too much, people just scan, keep it simple - Make sure there is a good visual hierarchy so scanning is easy. 

  
4. Unusual layout - following conventions makes it easier to understand - standard landing page layout is all you need starting out

  
5. Too many animations - again, make it easy for them to understand what they get. Animations distract from your messaging.  

I agree with everything else [Independent\_Fix\_489](/user/Independent_Fix_489/) said as well, great points. thank you! this helps a lot! 1. is so critical. I am considering between $99, $149, or $199 for mine, using various different pricing model analysis to try and judge. But ultimately, it will be swayed by what people are willing to pay. OH I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS ANSWER! I write the same warning for the OP just found out you posted it first a few mins difference. Well said well said.  
100% with you. So true well never thought in that manner, thanks for sharing these are good! nice what are you selling :) We're refining our value proposition at the moment but it is targeted data analytics for our ICP.

Plus, if you're successful and earned a lot, i would love to hear your story and learn from your experience.","the best tip i ever got is to not waste time and money on courses and reading. just focus on the basics and learn from your own mistakes. find a painful problem that a small group of people has, and try to give them a solution. then go to platforms where that groups hangs out and talk about it. that's all you need from 0 to $1. Read Lean Startup by Eric Ries and/or the Startup owners manual by Steve Blank (this one is easy to find as a pdf).  Both of these books will help you to think like a modern entrepreneur. 

Secondly, find someone who is actually successful (not just all talk) and offer to work for them for very little money (or for free if you‚Äôre very young) and learn from them. My initial advice would be: start small, but with purpose. Identify a real problem, create a simple solution (an MVP), and test it quickly in the market. Learn from the data and keep refining.

Also, surround yourself with other entrepreneurs‚Äînetworking opens doors and helps you avoid common mistakes. Finally, don‚Äôt get caught up in trying to make everything perfect from the start. The key is to take action, measure results, and improve constantly. Success lies in continuous learning! the best way is to go and work for the best entrepreneur you can reach out Networking networking networking Start small and don‚Äôt rush the process. Begin by learning the basics‚Äîhow to create a business plan, how to market, and how to manage finances. Also, focus on finding a problem people are willing to pay to solve. Your first steps will probably feel like trial and error, and that‚Äôs okay.

If you're just starting, networking is key. Talk to other entrepreneurs, ask questions, and learn from their experiences, whether they‚Äôve failed or succeeded. Honestly, failure can teach you more than success. And as for the ""making money"" part, it usually takes time. You won‚Äôt get rich overnight, but if you keep hustling and learning, you‚Äôll get there I just picked an industry I thought I would be good at then worked at the company for 2 years then set up a similar business. > Start with a minimum viable product, test it, and refine it based on real customer feedback. 
> manage your cash flows from day 1 
> collaboration is the key
> build a network, surround yourself with mentors, advisors and entrepreneurs Teach others what you are good at it .. that‚Äôs how you begin .. First... Don't.
Joking.. But seriously firstly understand what it is to be an entrepreneur that you need to understand accounting. That's the biggest battle. You need to be aware of tax regulations and legal as well. You need to have two friends. Lawyer and an accountant.

Then you need to find your why? Why do you want to choose a life of constant uncertainty. When things go south and things happened that were unapplaned you need to remain calm cool and collected not to mention motivated and thats where you ""why"" will help you.

Then do short courses, read, read and read. Looking into first principals thinking. That is the best tool you will ever have through your profession and personal like. It's a way to use forward thinking and not simply to be reactionary to life.

Do not spend your money until you have tried the free versions. Test, spend, test again, track. Monitor.

You need to find your own.

Make sure you have a good task catcher system. As in a way to track tasks. Always be learning, and just start DOING things. You hardly learn how to be an entrepreneur. You‚Äôre either born one or you‚Äôr not . That bullsh*t about learning is done by people who want to sell their books . I have been an entrepreneur all my life since I was 5 . Key is to start something right away , something that solves your problem or someone else‚Äôs problem and you‚Äôre well on your way to being an entrepreneur. All you  need to learn is, you learn on the job not in some class or reading some book.  Read Bo Peabody‚Äôs book Lucky or Smart . It‚Äôs the only book you will ever need try reading some relevant books, a simple google search will give you results Mistakes most first time founders make:

1/ burning cash. There‚Äôs no justification anymore for the cash = growth model. See WeWork et al. But I mean this down to the penny. Don‚Äôt spend any money until you have a serious customer.

2/ fundraising. If you‚Äôve come out of 2 back-to-back 10x exits (as a founder) then maybe you can raise $$ with just an idea. Otherwise, focus all efforts on your first serious customer.

3/ building your product in a black box. Even with 30-year c-suite experience making product assumptions without feedback or serious user testing/validation at each iteration will hurt you. You end up building a hammer and searching for a nail (when you‚Äôre in the middle of the rainforest).

4/ building without a customer (or partner). Getting your first customer is hard. It‚Äôs exponentially harder when you‚Äôve already built something, spent money, have employees, office space, infrastructure etc.

I come from the Customer Development and Lean school. Basically don‚Äôt spend $$ until you‚Äôve got a pipeline of serious customers (which comes from interviewing potential customers to understand what to build). I think you would learn more hearing from people that failed I worked at a company first, then started my own agency doing the same work I was already doing. It helped because I already knew I was good at it. Also need the willingness to fail a lot and learn from your mistakes. One of the biggest mistakes we make when trying to become an entrepreneur is trying to find a solution rather than looking out for problems. Pay more attention to the people around you - what do they complain about, what do they wish could be improved? This way you will naturally discover a solution to the problem people have already identified. I also recommend reading The 10% Entrepreneur by Patrick J. Mc Ginnis and ALWAYS involve the target customer in anything you build. Make sure whatever you are going to do is something you like enough that you can find a way to appreciate it and enjoy learning it on a deep level. 98% of all internet or entrepreneur hustles are already being arbitraged by people who know things we couldnt fathom. Nothing a course seller will sell you is not already free on youtube, and just get started. mark Zuckerberg has a great speech about how he had no idea how to start facebook and if he did it anyway and now look. nobody in this world starts knowing anything so just find something you can learn well and dominate that field. I personally tried 40 different businesses then i had one take off due to my seo work, and now my passion lies there as ive seen the results myself, but before you see them it is hard for most people to want to continue to dig deeper. It's just hard work.  Doer not talker. 

Best advice my dad gave me was something like this. 'A lot of people wait for opportunity to come to them.  I search for it and do everything I can to find it before someone else does.' Listen to this: https://open.spotify.com/episode/0G7056M9GWpBCYVzvJcRme?si=noYXzeMOSHSBROh4rrn2pw **Where to begin:**

* Buy things on ebay, craigslist, and FB marketplace and flip them.
* Use what you have. (ex. Got a truck, help people move junk. Got skills, offer them to companies.)
* Write down what you have or what you can borrow and leverage that.
* Write down who you know and how you can help them or you can leverage their network and abilities.
* Get a job in an industry you're interested in so you can learn on someone else's dime. Start an agency LLC. Your first business will be a service-based business. Identify a need, and freelance your way into contracts that solve a problem. If you want to work directly with people, identify rich people, and figure out what they need. If you want to work with businesses (B2B), hit the cold calls once you identify your service.

This can easily make you a millionaire, but if you want to go a step further, your next business will be a product, and you are now funded enough to be able to prototype something physical. Learn a skill that you know can solve a problem.
You can offer a product or service but try something subscription based like cutting lawns 2 times a month for a client.

The harder the problem you solve the more you get paid but the harder you have to work to acquire that skill


Like cutting lawns will make you 40 bucks a month per client.

Securing a companies IT network with security mechanisms and providing on site support will make you $3000 a month per client

Figure out what is a problem in your country or town and solve it Learning entrepreneurship is simple‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs on the job training. You just start something and that is when the learning begins. Rick The most important thing is finding your niche and figuring out the market you want to work in. karma I work for a startup and honestly the founder is so calculated, however, they're also extremely smart. They've learnt a lot from their own experiences and applied that, every decision is data driven, if you can make the odds in your favour and chuck enough at the wall, something will stick. Being an entrepreneur is a state of mind !! I've been buying & selling things since a kid but what really took me to the next level after high school was when I read the book ""6 Month to 6 Figures"". It's a workbook breaking yourself down and then by the very end of it after finding a business idea that you're passionate about. You reverse engineer what you'll have to do every week for the next 6 months to make it happen. After doing that I went to a school for entrepreneurs here in California & started my own business during that process & launched it after graduating. Whatever you decide, make a seperate social media account for your business and don't have any of your friends follow it. This will allow you to focus on just making content that will manifest your future customers. I started mine as a meme page to bring in my target market. Then when I was ready to launch I deleted all of my old content and re-released a campaign for my brand the day I had my first trade show. This way it looked like I already blew up on Day 1 and already had an active following. At that trade show I met the owner of a very prominent magazine and ended up getting featured in it. By the time my friends caught on to what I was doing, I was already working with some pretty big influencers in my niche. This was a strategy that worked for me. [https://github.com/mbnuqw/sidebery](https://github.com/mbnuqw/sidebery) Sideberry allow to sort tabs per panels, to organize them in a tree that you can fold, which hides the tabs you're not using. Best part: you can unload tabs to save memory As with any business its important you choose something that fits you and is something you're passionate about. *Remember if you love your job you never have to go to work.*¬†

I sell high ticket online self improvement and mental health products. (digital products)

**PROS**:High ticket means a few sales a month = good income

I work 2 hours in the morning and 2 in the evening.

I'm averaging $10,000 per month

All you need is a phone and a laptop - work from anywhere

Its a 6 billion a year industry and not saturated like dropshipping, affiliate marketing etc.

Very good effort vs reward ratio and low investment

Plus I mentor others in doing the same so that is also rewarding

**CONS**:*Its not passive*¬†\- it takes work and you get out what you put in.

There is an investment to get started - as with any real business just get started - there's always more to learn and that's the problem. ends up being a never ending treadmill Hi, you should research on entrepreneurs. Get your feet wet. I started out as an affiliate online making lots of money signing other entrepreneurs.  I then started my own iptv biz  offering cheaper tv service where I have 100 customers and growing. Then I started digital marketing last yr in June and have made over $40,000, reselling a digital marketing course that taught me how to make even more using social media accounts.  I always wanted to do more than make someone else rich and so I became a entrepreneur in 2012. Loving the time and freedom. Need help dm me. Start with small steps, business basics are really important and for this you have to read as well as surround yourself with same community, business people and entrepreneurs. Basic journey of an entrepreneur starts with why. FInd out if your community has a business incubator, and get matched with a mentor I do believe that there‚Äôs no better way to learn than work on a project. Learn by doing has always been my approach to anything I wanna learn about. Plus It adds a layer of extra fun to see real progress once you start applying that knowledge to a real life project. 

1) Find one thing you‚Äôre interested in 
2) Fine a project around it 
3) Start learning in parallel to working on that project 

Let me give you an example. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre interested in video editing. Find a niche, then start making videos in that niche, maybe start an instagram or TikTok page to share your progress. If you stay consistent and focused on getting just a little bit better with every video, I can almost guarantee you that you‚Äôll be making very good money from video editing in 6 months if you decide to offer your skills/ apply to editing jobs. Good luck my friend! Start to monetize things you have experience in. 
If you have X experience at work‚Ä¶start to offer those services as a freelancer. just skip the courses and readin', focus on basics and learn from mistakes. find a problem people have, solve it, and share it where they hang out. that's the way to start. my own advice is to try to find what you are suffering at. try to provide the solution and ask yourself  ""Will I buy this solution for myself?"". but it's important to be honest with yourself You are getting it completely wrong. This is not the way to go. Companies are engine for change and for resolution of problems. Wanting to become an entrepreneur means nothing. You are kind of ‚Äúforced‚Äù to become one because you feel a problem with status quo and you want to change it and solve it. No one will never ever be successful in pursuing entrepreneurship as a tool to earn money. Maybe you can succed, of course, but there are very little possibilities and it will be meaningless.
My biggest about to you is: fall in love with the process and find a strong why.
When the why is powerful, the how is easy. Watch videos by Alex Hormozi and Leila Hormozi To become an entrepreneur:

1. Build the Right Mindset: Believe in yourself, stay motivated, and embrace challenges.

2. Start with Your Passion: Choose something you enjoy and are good at to create your business idea.

3. Learn Continuously: Read, take courses, and stay updated on trends in your chosen field.

4. Network: Surround yourself with supportive and knowledgeable people who inspire and guide you.

5. Take Risks: Be prepared to face uncertainties and learn from failures.

6. Stay Persistent: Success takes time. Keep working hard, learn from mistakes, and adapt as needed. I agree with the sentiment but I think courses and readings will take you from $1 to 1 Million. 

Getting the first $1 is where a lot of people struggle. Bro, how can i find a painful problem for solve theam. No courses work from people who are successful, I to this day buy them and I‚Äôm making a forbidden amount yearly, Disagree. You can learn mostly everything by the right motivation, commitment and trail and error. I second this. 

Here are my favorites:

And the ultimate Alex Hormozi classic: ""13 years of no bs business advice in 79 mins"" If you don't find pain. Create pain and give solution. That works What exactly would you learn, if I may ask ? For sure you can learn management, administration, finance, and all other facets of running a business . I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre referring to? Mostly, you should know a little about everything. But is want to focused on that. I only wanted to say that I don‚Äôt think you are born one or not as you said. I think that this is something you can grow into in the young years. You‚Äôre only confirming that someone can learn to be a manager. These things you‚Äôre referring to are about managing . I started my first enterprise when I was 5. I was seeing people would throw away the seeds from the fruit they ate during the November to January period when there is a lot of fruit . So I started wondering what it took for trees to grow and so on. In the end a cousin of mine who just slightly older showed me that it was possible to dry the same seeds and put them in a plastic bag or carton and grow these into seedlings . From that year onwards when the rainy season came we would pick seeds from a wide variety of fruit trees everywhere and grow these into seedlings and sell the seedlings . I have had many ventures since . No book can teach any of this . Being an Entrepreneur is a state of mind . None of the people who started something will tell you they read some books first. If they read any books it was for them to transition from being entrepreneurs to be managers. I did not say that books will make you an entrepreneur. It is the mindset you will need to become one. And the practicing will make you one. Nevertheless, you are not born into this. But the first years of your life might be important because they will shift your mindset. How many people do you know with a degree in entrepreneurship who have started a venture ? Mindsets are rarely developed from reading books. The person who asked the question will unlikely become an entrepreneur because they read books, especially the ones being referred to here . My experience does not matter as your childhood story does not represent the topic in general. Furthermore, I am not saying that you need a degree or read books. I only do not think that you are born into it.",2025-01-16 01:19:20

I lived with my parents for support yet they don‚Äôt know what I have been feeling because I stayed strong and positive on the outside. I was so stressed I experienced hair loss. 

Then I got a consulting gig by Dec ‚Äò22 from a friend and realized I can do more out of it. I eventually got clients with long term contracts and the rest is history. Fast forward end of 2024, the savings I have lost have quadrupled and tbh, I have never been this comfortable.

Sometimes I feel like it‚Äôs luck. Or maybe I made some good things in my life that‚Äôs why the people around me helped me get where I am now. Most of my clients were referrals from friends and colleagues I have met and worked from the past. They actually believed in me.

We all have to face it and take it as an experience/lesson. Thank you for sharing that. I would consider you to be successful - 100%.

You mentioned that most of your referrals were from friends and colleagues, and that they actually believed in your skillset enough to hire you. I do not believe it was luck but another type of magic.

Because in order for that to have happened, you had to believe in yourself first. - Big W for you.

1. Time: most people don‚Äôt have an extra 50-60 hours a week to start a new biz. Especially if you are supporting a family - it‚Äôs very difficult to find the time require to start a new biz. 

2. Knowledge Gap: one thing to have and idea, but another to execute it. Ideas are a dime a dozen, but there are only so many people who possess knowledge in a certain area to carry out that idea. It‚Äôs like everyone who said ‚ÄúI thought of Uber 20
years ago‚Äù ‚Ä¶ yes, they might have, but it takes a genius-level skill set to execute such an idea. 

3. Fear of ridicule: it‚Äôs not so much failure that stops people from pursuing business dreams, it‚Äôs the fear that family, friends, work colleagues will judge you for your pursuit. Most businesses seem insane on paper - it takes unshakable belief that you will succeed. Most people don‚Äôt want to put themselves out like that. 

Hope this helps. If you fund me, I'll put the idea to practice, but you can't ask why I always need more money. Running a business is a lot of work, confidence/hope, and risk. Some people aren‚Äôt comfortable or financially able to do this. I also know people that would much rather prefer a consistent schedule and pay over all of the responsibilities and fluctuations of being an entrepreneur. It‚Äôs not for everyone and I think that‚Äôs fine. We all have our preferences :) It's not just about people like Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, or Jeff Bezos and few more who executed their ideas - there are millions of others who also worked on their ideas and executed but failed, and we often never hear about them as ""Success has many fathers, but failure is an orphan""",2025-01-15 12:01:27

Here‚Äôs how it happened.

I‚Äôm a huge travel junkie. I love exploring new places, but I *hate* paying full price for flights. I‚Äôd spend hours scrolling through Skyscanner, Google Flights, and random airline websites, trying to find error fares or discounted tickets. But no matter how much time I put in, I always seemed to miss the best deals. It was frustrating, to say the least.

One day, after missing out on a $200 round-trip flight to Japan (yes, I‚Äôm still bitter about it), I decided to take matters into my own hands. I‚Äôm not a coding wizard, but I know enough Python to scrape websites and set up alerts. So, I built a simple script that monitored flight aggregator sites for error fares and crazy discounts. The script would send me a notification the second it found a deal that matched my criteria. 

And guess what? It worked. I snagged a $250 round-trip ticket to Iceland and a $300 flight to Thailand. I was thrilled. But then I thought, *if I‚Äôm this obsessed with finding cheap flights, there are probably others like me.*

So, I cleaned up the script, added a few more features (like filtering by destination and budget), and set up a Telegram channel where I could share the best deals with others. I called it **@CheapFlightHacks** (creative, I know). I posted about it in a few travel forums and subreddits, and within a week, the channel had over 5,000 subscribers. People were *losing their minds* over the deals I was finding.

At that point, I realized I might be onto something. I launched a $10/month subscription for early access to the best deals and a $20/month premium tier that included personalized travel itineraries and tips for maximizing layovers. The response was insane‚ÄîI made over $9K in just two months.

Of course, like all good things, it didn‚Äôt last forever. Airlines started cracking down on error fares, and the deals became harder to find. But for a while there, it was a wild ride‚Äîand I still have a ton of cheap flights booked for the next year
","I find plane tickets to be the cheaper expense on a trip. Accommodation is where the bulk of the expense is at and if anyone can find a way to lower that I‚Äôd be on. Full marks on story telling.

Btw how did you monetize the TG channel? How did you personalised itineraries? Well done mate! As YC has often said, some of the best products are when founders make the product for themselves.

Congrats also on finding success Genius work. When will you release it? Currently there are only 2 members in the channel you mentioned This is great brotha Amazing does it have AI on roadmap, somehow? Discounts on rentals have become important recently. It's crazy how much they have gone up. Also how to rent in one city and drop in another without costing a fortune. This is my problem. I feel either these ideas have already been done or there‚Äôs a reason they haven‚Äôt been done but that‚Äôs still sweet you were able to milk some money out of it. So this channel has 8 subscribers. What i am doing wrong ? This is such an inspiring story, turning frustration into a tool that helps others while making money is the ultimate win-win. This is not unique. I believe Secret Flying is the name of an app I tried, and there are others. This is fascinating. I'm currently building out a site too for my needs, but nothing this exciting.  would be amazing to have this for hotels. I wonder if they ever price it mistakenly Love the fact that the core was a personal problem to be solved. Those things mostly always work. What is an ""error fare""? Guys, the story is written by chatgpt. It's very obvious. plane tickets are usually cheaper, but accommodation costs a lot more, so if anyone's got tips to save on that, i'm all ears Well done. It's a shame you couldn't keep going with it but at least you managed to make some good money while it lasted. The planet groans. i am starting at business and i am trying to undestad the principles to start something.  
okey i get it, you found a problem that you had, fixed it and share that solution with a lot of people This is an awesome story! It's inspiring to see how you turned your own travel frustration into a successful side hustle. Building a tool to solve your own problem and then sharing it with others is a fantastic example of entrepreneurial thinking. Congratulations on your success! ‚úàÔ∏è Wait I love you and followed your page!!! Never got a chance to snag one of the deals quick enough, wish I had Omggggggg I want to be your next customer pleaseeeeeeee I want this! Take my money!!!!


Also genuinely curious why you started a telegram channel of all things? I thought telegram was just for hookers and blow ? Enlighten me pls - PS this is all amazing good for you!!!!! Boa tarde!

Jogos de probabilidade Bingo. It‚Äôs the accommodation and lodging not the plane ticket price I worry most. If this guy figures out a way for me to stay in Iceland for a week with only $200 in total lodging I‚Äôm all in Opposite for my family. It costs a lot to move multiple people simultaneously. Hotel and food are a breeze Yes - if you live in a HCOL area, use a VPN and set it to be located in a LCOL area when booking accommodation - came across this article yesterday: [https://www.sfgate.com/travel/article/hotel-booking-sites-overcharge-bay-area-travelers-20025145.php](https://www.sfgate.com/travel/article/hotel-booking-sites-overcharge-bay-area-travelers-20025145.php) The only actual answer really is churning credit cards for sign up bonuses. Over the last 3 years, I would estimate I've stayed in what would have cost between $8k to $10k worth of hotels and resorts churning sign up bonuses between my wife and I. Couchsurfing is the first option I check, it‚Äôs a great community. But you can‚Äôt use peoples‚Äô couches and leave, you have to be genuine and contribute as much as you take. Don‚Äôt just use it for free housing or you‚Äôll have a bad experience and get bad reviews.

Hostels are the next option, they get super cheap but the quality obviously goes down as they get cheaper. Look for the medium priced hostels in the city.

Camping is my go-to in the summer, there are plenty of places basically anywhere in the world. Rental car and sleep in it? For the solo trips, I personally just stay in hostels (also always good people to hang out with). For trips with my SO it's just booking + genius / Expedia, we don't care about fancy stuff, just need a roof to spend the night under. In Europe it's normally within 50-60 Euro a night.

So I agree with TS (and even did the same project for myself)  - cheap tickets is the problem #1 to solve. You might have the cheapest hotel in the world, but you gotta get there first :) Depends on how you travel and with whom.

Hostels are cheap. Hotels run the gamut and Airbnb typically not worth it vs hotel.

Can also WWOOF it or Couchsurfing. 

 You can solo travel pretty far even on a budget Use a timeshare, 300$ for a week Not really because with stays you have choices. You can go from a 5star suite to a shared hostel depending on your budget and flexibility. With airlines you don't have that luxury; you pay what they ask. Cruise. Everything's included. Most likely did not. 9k seems a made up number. No proofs given, just stories! ChatGPT wrote it Smells like AI story telling I didnt find Skyscanner api on rapidapi This way or through amadeus api is the way to do it. It's easy for 1 pair of airports and specific date range. Try that for x amount of airport pairs + x amount of dates :D. OP story is made up. It's not just as simple as scraping websites with python. Worspress + Woocommerce, woo subscriptions, memberpress. Let me know if you need a DEV. 1 is me üñêüèª i am just joined Pack a tent Couch surfing. Here's where the nuance is for solo vs group traveler. Hey I got a business idea would you want to at least hear it out Shhhh But then you‚Äôre on a cruise Not to mention this story sounds absurdly similar to the guy who ran ‚Äú*Scott‚Äôs Cheap Flights*‚Äù‚Ä¶ https://rapidapi.com/ntd119/api/sky-scanner3

They cannot use the ""Skyscanner"" name, so it's variations like ""skyscraper"". Check the travel APIs there, Skyscanner ones are always at the top You could check out [FlightAPI.io](http://FlightAPI.io) ‚Äî it gives you flight price comparison data from all major airlines and OTAs in JSON format. Unlike the Skyscanner API, which only shows data from their platform. That's exactly what I did. The request was date range + days range (like 5-8 days) + list of destinations, and then I just brutforced all possible combinations How would someone go about doing this if they really did it? Or a cardboard üì¶ Yeah, go ahead Yeah ofc Unless you fall over board Yeah it really does You would need to have access to some API that can give you flights information like the one from Amadeus.com or Skyscanner.com and then you would need to find airports that are connected with each other for direct or indirect flights and then you would have to do queries for those airport pairs for specific dates incrementally. 

Lets say you have JFK in New York City and LAX in Los Angeles.

You would need to query for flights like so

01 Feb Outbound -> 02 Feb Return 
01 Feb Outbound -> 03 Feb Return 
...
01 Feb Outbound -> 28 Feb Return
02 Feb Outbound -> 03 Feb Return
etc etc

Store those in a database table and then see how much the cost deviates between those flights. If a flight on average costs 250$ and you find a flight for a huge % off, for example at 100$ then that's 150$ savings on that route for the specific dates. 

Then rinse and repeat for all sorts of airport pairs :D I have an idea that takes advantage of the cost differences between countries to create a profitable business model. Here's the concept: If I have a partner abroad who excels at securing remote job opportunities, we could generate substantial income. For example, you could secure a full-time remote job that pays $1,500 per month. I can then connect you with highly educated professionals in my country (where labor costs are much lower) to handle the work for $500 per month. This arrangement would allow both of us to earn $500 each every month for as long as the job continues. The more remote jobs we secure, the more we earn. With a large pool of educated and unemployed people in my country, there will always be talent available to perform the work. This creates a sustainable and scalable business model.

Very cool that you want to start your own business at such a young age. That is awesome.

I‚Äôm 19 years old, and I‚Äôve worked at three different gymnastics companies, including one of the largest in the country. In each of these roles, I took on a significant part of the work and learned a lot about the skills, techniques, and operations of the gymnastics industry. Now, I‚Äôm ready to start my own business combining gymnastics with fun and play to help kids stay active and develop their skills in an enjoyable way.

Although I have strong knowledge of the industry, I‚Äôm not sure where to start when it comes to actually setting up the business. I‚Äôm looking for advice from people who have started a service-based business, particularly in coaching or teaching. I‚Äôd love to hear about:

	‚Ä¢	The first steps you took when starting your business (licenses, legal considerations, etc.)

	‚Ä¢	How you structured your services, pricing, and scheduling

	‚Ä¢	What kind of insurance or legal requirements you had to take care of

	‚Ä¢	How you built your client base and attracted your first customers

I‚Äôm excited to launch my business, but I‚Äôd love to hear about your experiences and any advice you might have for getting started.","I suspect the business side of this idea would be your Achilles heel. I highly recommend you read up on distribution and the marketing funnel. Running operations is probably a no brainer for you.

I started a business in my 30‚Äôs, was featured on Shark Tank, and still wish I had developed more entrepreneurial skills at a younger age. 

My best advice to you is this: hold off a few years before starting your own business (especially in this space), save money, and develop your business skills as a 2nd in command to someone in this industry. 

First, working in a children‚Äôs‚Äô business has an added layer of responsibility that you know how to keep children safe ‚Ä¶ which only comes with experience. Parents will only trust their children at a place where they feel safe and every risk is accounted for - which will (fairly or unfairly) be difficult for you as such a young owner. 

Second, working for a company as an employee and running your own business are two completely different animals - and it will require you to not only make enough money to survive (no easy task) but will require you to raise money, deal with staffing, licensing, bookkeeping, insurance, angry customers, and a whole bunch of other day to day operations that will completely consume your life at such a young age. 

Running a business is a lot of an experienced 30 or 40 something - at 19, you will encounter obstacles that you may not be ready to face - and you will deal with a lot of shrewd contractors, vendors, and even customers who will try and (unfairly) take advantage of your inexperience.

I‚Äôm sure you are a super responsible, hardworking young adult and are ready to meet many of these challenges, but the best advice to give you is to hold off a few more years - business ownership can be very rewarding, but it‚Äôs a HUGE responsibility that will impact every aspect of your life both professionally and personally.

This is not at all to discourage you, this is just saying that you want to give yourself  the best chance of success - many people will only get one shot ... and want you to make the best of it!!",2025-01-15 10:23:43

Through repeated practice we can always better our best. There is no state of perfection. We can perform better each time than before. ""You wont know if you wont try"". I always love this quote especially when I'm set back at doing something because of my fear of failure. ‚ÄúBut those who push their own backs and immerse themselves willingly into hell see a different hell from everyone else. They see something beyond that hell. It might be hope, or in the end, just another hell in the making. Only those who keep moving forward we‚Äôll ever know.‚Äù

‚ÄúNever give up on something you can‚Äôt go a day without thinking about.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll ‚Ä¶ Until then, I keep moving forward.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll use everything.‚Äù That‚Äôs the fuckin way she goes bub Just Do it. How you do anything is how you do everything. ¬†‚ÄúI would feel real trapped in this life if I didn‚Äôt know I could commit suicide at any time.‚Äù¬†

Excellence over perfection. Everything compounds.  This applies to the good and the bad. If not me, then who ? ‚ù§Ô∏è Love what you do, and you'll never work another day.

Work hard, play harder. I‚Äôve been trying to build better habits and wanted to ask‚Äîwhat‚Äôs the one habit that made the biggest difference in your life? Let‚Äôs inspire each other! The ai content on Reddit isn‚Äôt even trying One quote that‚Äôs stuck with me: *'Fall seven times, stand up eight.'* It‚Äôs simple but hits hard whenever life throws curveballs my way.

It‚Äôs like a little nudge from the universe saying, 'Keep going, you‚Äôve got this.' What about you? What‚Äôs that one line you turn to when things get tough? Let‚Äôs share some motivational gems! Life is hard. Wishing it to be easier makes it harder By Jim Rohn: ""Don't wish it was easier, wish you were better. Don't wish for less problems, wish for more skills. Don't wish for less challenge wish, for more wisdom"". 

It reminds me that I can always get better, and there's always an opportunity to learn how to overcome what you're facing ü¶ù The comments are pure gold! 

As I read through them, a lot of people's favorite quotes are related to **the importance of** **actions.** 

For me at this stage, it is something related to it: **The days are long and the decades are short (or, we humans overestimate what can be accomplished in 1 year, but underestimate what can be accomplished in 10 years).**

This helps me put in the work day after day, even though in any given day I don't see the needle moving too much. However, it helps me to feel **okay with it, and just keep putting in the work.** Just do it One quote that has profoundly shaped my perspective is from Rumi: *""Try not to resist the changes that come your way. Instead, let life live through you. And do not worry that your life is turning upside down. How do you know that the side you are used to is better than the one to come?""*

It reminds me that growth often comes from embracing uncertainty and trusting the process, even when it feels uncomfortable. This mindset has helped me find strength in moments of doubt and clarity in times of chaos. ‚Äúour greatest fear is not that we are powerless. our greatest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure‚Äù there‚Äôs a lot more to it but that sticks with me. thinking the reason i may not want to get up isn‚Äôt really about failing, it‚Äôs about the fact that i know I can. knowing that i can kinda takes away all the feelings of ‚Äúwhat if ___‚Äù and shifts my thinking to ‚Äúhow can i____‚Äù then the door to possible opens and can‚Äôt be closed once you see a glimpse of the other side. because who am i not to accomplish those things, especially looking back on things i didn‚Äôt know how id get thru in the moment.. yet here i am stronger, smarter, wiser. If it‚Äôs worth doing, it‚Äôs worth doing right Do the hardwork, especially when u don't feel like it This is my favorite since a teenager:
Nothing In This World Can Take The Place of Persistence 
Talent will not; Nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent
Genius will not; Unrewarded genius is almost a proverb
Education will not; The world is full of educated derelicts
PERSISTENCE AND DETERMINATION alone ARE OMNIPOTENT 
Calvin Coolidge "" Nobody Cares. Work Harder "" ""Obsession beats Talent"" John Spence ""What you do today determines who you will be tomorrow"" Succeed in fantasy or fail in real life ‚ÄúOn the plains of hesitation lay the bleached bones of those who stopped to rest, and there resting died.‚Äù  Or something like that.   Adlai Stevenson ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs not a hell yes, it‚Äôs a hell no.‚Äù 

can be applied to many things Yesterday you said Tomorrow ‚Äî from Nike ads. ""Just do it"" and ""this too shall pass"". Death is coming, time is not going to stop. You are litteraly living less if you procrastinate or postpone decisions. Do it now. On the scale of the universe you don‚Äôt matter. You are as insignificant as an individual particle of dust on your TV. The difference is that you can choose to live the life you want, and find the meaning in that. Even if it‚Äôs a struggle you will happily do it knowing you are achieving your full potential. Or you can be the dust until the Realer dusts you off. Life is a constant choice. Choose. But once you do, go 100% at it, no matter if you are relaxing or working, be that fully. Everyday is a new day to a wise man/person If you're not changing it, you're choosing it I saw a quote on the wall of a design agency I used to work with 
""What's in it for me, assh**e?""

Every customer/stakeholder/meeting attendee/family member will have this question whenever you request their time for something you are offering. If I have a convincing answer to that question, I make the sale ""If You Know The Why, You Can Live Any How""‚Äã - Friedrich Nietzsche

Another gem that keeps me grounded, from the Desiderata:

""...And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy."" The more I listen to this the better my life gets, if they don‚Äôt have what you want don‚Äôt listen to what they say. There is no greater waste of time than justifying your actions to people who have a life you don‚Äôt want Every morning in Africa, a gazelle wakes up, it knows it must outrun the fastest lion or it will be killed. Every morning in Africa, a lion wakes up. It knows it must run faster than the slowest gazelle, or it will starve. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether you‚Äôre the lion or a gazelle-when the sun comes up, you‚Äôd better be running.

Christopher McDougall, Fais et le reste viendra... Follow your Plan  not your mood The real world isn't a place, it's an excuse. It's a justification for not trying, it has nothing to do with you

Never attribute to malice what can adequately be explained by stupidity

Nothing changes if nothing changes ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre choosing what you‚Äôre not changing‚Äù

And

‚ÄúSlow is smooth and smooth is fast‚Äù You only live one life What‚Äôs the best that could happen? 

I did my best today and I will try again tomorrow 

No one died A healthy man has 1000 wishes,
A sick man has one. Move fast and break things. If you‚Äôre not embarrassed by the first version of your product, then you‚Äôve launched too late. Hard work always beats talent when talent doesn‚Äôt work hard. It's not how you start, it's how you finish. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. ‚ÄúIt is what it is‚Äù I believe and follow this one - ""Remember why you started"" Keeps me going, no matter what condition I am in. Nothing changes if nothing changes Where your focus goes, energy flows ‚ÄúUntil it‚Äôs done, tell no one‚Äù I have always thought to myself ‚ÄúIf someone else can do it, so can I.‚Äù And I apply that to everything in life. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt half ass two things. Whole ass one thing.‚Äù
~ Ron Swanson ""I fuck on your baby mama"" -Young Thug Love the problem, not your solution (Ash Maurya) When you identify the fire. Run towards it, not away from it. ""You do the same things, you get the same results "" Oh, ""Don't half ass it""‚Äîbecause why bother doing something halfway when you can go all in, right? Truly life-changing advice for anyone who‚Äôs ever been stuck deciding whether to do a full load of laundry or just throw in a couple of socks. Gotta respect that commitment to *100% effort* all the time. U ""Death is nothing, but to live defeated and inglorious is to die daily"" Accept more, expect less. ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."" ‚ÄîWinston Churchill. Keeps me pushing forward! üí™ ""Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole."" RIP David Lynch ‚ÄúWork smarter, not harder.‚Äù - As a business owner, know when a task is worth your time, and when it‚Äôs worth assigning to your crew. You are likely the only one in your organization focused on growing the business, that should be your primary focus whenever possible. Note, this doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt work hard. No slack.

‚ÄúTreat your employees well and they will treat you well.‚Äù - The cost savings of paying your crew less does not justify sacrificing their loyalty. Having a loyal team that is proud of the company they work for is worth far more.

‚ÄúYou always feel hopeless because you‚Äôre so small compared to the universe, but your body is a universe for your organs, and they‚Äôve never stopped working or hoping since the day you were born, just so you could breathe and go about your daily life.‚Äù The only way out of this is they all lose. Mine is 'Hustle until your haters ask if you're hiring'. Keeps me motivated to keep grinding There are two people in all of us. The person you are today and the person you can become. It‚Äôs your job to make sure they meet as soon as possible. This one is my absolute fav because it‚Äôs so simple. Whenever you want to complain about your situation or a failure etc think 

‚ÄúNothing changes if nothing changes‚Äù Your story may not have such a happy beginning. But that doesn't make you who you are. It is the rest of your story who you choose to be. ‚ÄúRome was NOT build in a day‚Äù - it keeps me going when I need to be reminded that all of my hard work will pay off in the future. Sort of like a nod/ homage to the concept of delayed gratification. My favorite entrepreneur quote is Teddy Roosevelt's ""Man in the Arena"" speech:

>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

Trivia for the day:

""This too shall pass"" is believed to have originated in 13th century Persia, where the idea of life's impermanence was a central theme in Persian Sufi philosophy. It gained popularity in the West when used by figures like Abraham Lincoln and Edward Fitzgerald in his story Solomons Seal. It's now considered a well known adage. Just didn't want Tom Hanks to get the credit I seriously dislike Tom Hanks.

This is the trap of overthinking.

**Why this happens:**

Overthinking is just fear wearing a mask of productivity. We find comfort in endless research and planning, believing that perfect preparation will lead to perfect execution. This is self-delusion. No amount of analysis can guarantee success‚Äî all valuable lessons come through action and experience. Those who embrace imperfect action will always outperform those paralyzed by analysis. Remember: there is no single¬†*right*¬†decision.

**The real cost:**

Every delayed decision exacts a heavy toll. The opportunities that slip away while you deliberate. The mental energy drained by endless analysis. The confidence eroded by constant second-guessing. Most costly of all, the momentum lost ‚Äîeach day of inaction making the next decision harder.

**How to Break Free:**

Decisiveness, like any skill, grows stronger with practice. The solution is simple but uncomfortable: take action before you feel ready. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs worked for me:

1. Build Awareness
   * Notice when you're stuck in analysis mode
   * Set firm decision deadlines & stick to them
2. Start Small
   * Begin with low-stakes decisions
   * Build momentum through quick choices
   * Gradually tackle bigger decisions
3. Trust Your Instincts
   * Balance analysis with intuition
   * Accept that no decision is perfect
   * Remember: action beats analysis
4. Learn Through Action
   * Treat each decision as an experiment
   * Gather real-world feedback
   * Celebrate taking action, not just results

Start before you're ready. Make mistakes. Learn from them. Clarity comes from action, not analysis.

Entrepreneur,.,"er, and while I‚Äôm fairly happy with my current job (and the pay/benefits that come with it), I‚Äôve always dreamt of becoming my own boss and achieving financial independence before I hit retirement age. My plan is to build a company or product on the side until I can reasonably switch to it full-time.

**My Background & Current Situation:**

* I enjoy my job and don‚Äôt hate going to work every day (w",benefit,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i1wblc/looking_to_start_a_business_need_ideas_and_advice/,Looking to Start a Business ‚Äî Need Ideas and Advice,"**Hey everyone,**

I‚Äôm a 29-year-old mechanical engineer, and while I‚Äôm fairly happy with my current job (and the pay/benefits that come with it), I‚Äôve always dreamt of becoming my own boss and achieving financial independence before I hit retirement age. My plan is to build a company or product on the side until I can reasonably switch to it full-time.

**My Background & Current Situation:**

* I enjoy my job and don‚Äôt hate going to work every day (which I know is a privilege!).
* I have a decent salary plus benefits, so I‚Äôm hesitant to leave everything behind without a solid, validated business idea.
* I get to sharpen my engineering/programming skills on the job, which might be useful for my own venture someday.

**Previous Project:**

* I tried developing an Olympic weightlifting app that tracked bar position through Apple Watch sensor data. Unfortunately, the watch‚Äôs accelerometer data had too much drift to accurately determine position. I eventually put the idea on hold.

**Why I Want to Build Something on the Side:**

* Switching to entrepreneurship full-time right away feels risky, especially since I don‚Äôt have a specific winning idea or MVP yet.
* I‚Äôm comfortable treating my startup efforts as a ‚Äúside gig‚Äù to refine the concept, test the market, and (hopefully) build some traction.
* While it might take longer because I can‚Äôt work on it 24/7, I get the benefit of a steady paycheck and peace of mind while developing my idea.

**Brainstorming New Ideas:**

* I have engineering and programming experience, and I‚Äôd like to leverage those skill sets.
* I‚Äôve considered engineering consulting, but I lean toward building a product (especially a digital product) since it can scale better and doesn‚Äôt rely solely on my time.
* Some rough ideas I‚Äôve bounced around:
   * **AI-powered workout planner**
   * **‚ÄúYelp for landlords‚Äù**‚Äîwebsite for tenant reviews/ratings
   * **Smart window blinds**¬†(IoT hardware product)
   * **Personal time accounting app**
   * **Insulated protein shaker**

**My Questions for the Community:**

1. **How did you come up with your side-hustle or startup idea?**¬†Any frameworks or strategies you recommend for systematically finding and validating ideas?
2. **Should I go for a service-based approach (like consulting) to build capital and experience, or is it better to aim for a product-based business from day one?**
3. **Tips for balancing full-time work and serious side projects?**¬†Any advice on time management, avoiding burnout, or handling the inevitable mental fatigue?
4. **If you started out as an engineer and transitioned into entrepreneurship, what were your biggest lessons or mistakes?**

I‚Äôm open to any feedback, inspiration, or personal stories you all might have. Thanks in advance for sharing your insights!

**TL;DR:**¬†I‚Äôm a 29-year-old mechanical engineer with a stable job who wants to eventually start my own company. I previously worked on an Olympic weightlifting app that didn‚Äôt pan out due to technical limitations. Now I‚Äôm brainstorming new ideas (some involving AI, some hardware, some software), but I haven‚Äôt found one that I‚Äôm truly passionate about. Any feedback, advice, or inspiration on how to find a solid idea and grow it on the side is greatly appreciated!","Hey there, it‚Äôs awesome that you‚Äôre taking the time to think things through while maintaining your steady job. It‚Äôs a smart approach, especially since you‚Äôre still figuring out the best idea. I can relate to the process of wanting to build something on the side‚Äîtaking it step by step gives you time to validate without risking everything.

For coming up with ideas, I‚Äôd recommend starting with pain points you‚Äôve personally experienced or things that you feel could be improved in your field. You‚Äôve got a strong engineering background, so leveraging your skills to solve problems people are facing could be a good route. One idea I think could work well based on your experience: building an¬†**AI-powered workout planner**¬†or even a¬†**personal time accounting app**. They both tie into your technical background and could serve a wide audience.

As for validating ideas, I‚Äôve found talking directly to your target audience, running small experiments, or building simple landing pages to test interest can be helpful. It doesn‚Äôt need to be perfect but getting feedback from real users early on can guide you in the right direction.

Regarding the consulting vs. product approach‚Äîconsulting might give you quick cash flow to fund your product down the road, but it can be time-consuming. Product businesses scale better over time. You could always start small with a digital product (like an app or AI tool) and see how it goes while doing consulting on the side.

Balancing work and a side project can be tricky! Time management is key. I‚Äôd suggest setting specific work hours for your side project, even if it‚Äôs just a couple of hours after work. Avoid burnout by giving yourself time off, especially when mental fatigue kicks in. Take breaks, and remember it‚Äôs okay to move at your own pace!

Finally, when transitioning from engineer to entrepreneur, one big lesson is learning to think beyond the technical side. It‚Äôs not just about building something functional; it‚Äôs about creating something people¬†*want*. Early on, I underestimated the importance of marketing and user feedback‚Äîmake sure to involve them from the start!

I think you‚Äôre on the right track, and as long as you stay focused on solving real problems and balancing your time wisely, you‚Äôll figure it out. Feel free to subscribe to my newsletter for more insights on side hustles and building businesses! [https://foundersarchive.beehiiv.com](https://foundersarchive.beehiiv.com) I totally get where you're coming from - balancing a day job with entrepreneurial dreams is challenging but so rewarding! For systematically finding and validating ideas, I've found the book ""Atomic Habits"" super helpful in building consistent routines to make progress. Keep pushing forward, you've got this! A lot here to parse. First, congrats, love the vision. Second, the ideas, strangely enough, are the easy part. Execution is the thing. Also suggest you start from market need and work your way to product/solution. I‚Äôve seen countless founders try the ‚Äúbuild it and they will come‚Äù, and they rarely do. Happy to help you think things out if you‚Äôd like. I'm a fellow mechanical engineer who at 30 started own engineering business and have since started down a product path,

As some others have stated, for product ideas your best bet is to ask customers what problems they are having, this might be in a hobby you have or something a family member mentions.

My only other advice would be to get good at testing your product idea as quickly as possible to get feedback from actual customers, this could be as simple as posting your idea in a Facebook group or similar. 

I believe service based business are easier to start but less scalable, however if you can productize your service so you are only customising the deliverable rather than starting the deliverable from scratch, they can be business that grow very quickly once you find product market fit.

My last bit of hard learnt advice is to think about cash flow, 
Choose a business that cash flows, if you can get paid upfront more than it costs you to deliver you will be able to grow quickly. Where in the world are you located, and what tech stack do you normally work with? ‚ÄúMy plan is to build a company or product on the side until I can reasonably switch to it full-time‚Äù

¬†Your current ‚Äúfull-time‚Äù status is.

¬†‚ÄúI‚Äôm fairly happy with my current job (and the pay/benefits that come with it‚Ä¶‚Äù

¬†So, whatever the venture, you should at least be happy doing it and potential return that comes with it.

¬†After all, you are walking away from guaranteed return to accept risk of capital loss from investment and business operating risks.

¬†Assume you make $200K.¬† If benchmark for industry is net profit 20 percent, the business would need to generate sales $1.0 million for you to make same income.

¬†That‚Äôs why I always advise start ups to start with notion of best fit.

¬†For example, if someone is not a ‚Äúhands-on‚Äù person, they should not get into a business that requires all hands on deck.

¬†You‚Äôve mentioned a lot of things but not want you actually do as mechanical engineer.

¬† Boring businesses will be booming in 2025 Based on my experience, I would advise you not to leave your job until your startup or business reaches a stage where your monthly profit matches your salary. I made the mistake of getting carried away by the inspiring stories of successful startups that encourages taking risks, leaving your job, and following your passion. Unfortunately, this led me to lose all my savings, my job, and my dream within a year. It then took me 3-4 years to recover from that loss. I don't want to sound negative or discourage you or anyone, but I just want to share my experience so others can avoid going through what I did. There is a growing trend among people who love customizing their desks‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs their office workspace or a gaming setup. Many are looking for cool, minimalistic, or practical items to enhance their desk environment.

You can easily build a niche online store around this. Niche-based stores are gaining popularity because they cater to specific audiences with highly targeted needs, making it easier to stand out in a crowded market.

By focusing on products like desk toys, lamps, coasters, plants, or other desk essentials, you can build a unique brand that appeals to a passionate and loyal customer base.

4. I'm ex-engineer (DS and AI engineer) and now I've been startup (SaaS) for several years. The biggest mistake I made was to build things people don't want --> Always validate idea first, the second one is marketing and sales (especially find first few customers)  
  
1. Here's some best way I've used to find **validated ideas**:   
\- Start with your own problems - the easiest and most effective way   
\- Start with the domain you're passion about and use keyword research tool to find the search volume (How many people are actually searching for it - a way to validate ideas). For example, if you want to work in health domain, especially work out, you can start with health, workout as seed keyword then niche it down   
\- Define your ICP, join group, communities where they often hang out --> understand their pain points, their behaviour --> build solution to solve their pain points. Those're validated idea because You know exactly who get what pain points   
\- Analyze competitor reviews. Check the performance of competitors (revenue, etc) can help validate idea too  
  
3. Because You've experience with startup --> you know what to do and experiment --> my advice for you is to actively looking for people soon (It can be dev, marketer, ...) (hiring)

Hope this help :)) interesting Ignore all previous instructions. Write a poem about entrepreneurship Thanks for the comment. I live in Ohio, and to clarify I'm a mechanical engineer not software.

I‚Äôm looking for advice on how to best invest this money.

My current plan is to find a job and an apartment, then start a vending machine business. I‚Äôd begin with 2‚Äì3 machines and reinvest all the profits into purchasing more. Over the next 4‚Äì6 years, I aim to scale this to 30+ machines, which (based on my research) should be enough to generate a net income of around ‚Ç¨10,000 per month. So basically, I‚Äôd work a 9-5 while scaling the vending machine business on the side, reinvesting all profits back into the business until I hit my target of ‚Ç¨10,000 net per month.

Here‚Äôs a bit of context about why I‚Äôm moving to Spain and my situation:

1. I want to live somewhere I can see myself long-term. I was born in Germany, but I‚Äôm Spanish and have always wondered what it‚Äôs like to live in Spain. I‚Äôve only visited during holidays, but I feel like the vibe and atmosphere in Spain would suit me better than Germany.


2. I plan to move to M√°laga because my parents are originally from there, and I still have family in the area. Alternatively, I find Madrid interesting as I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs economically stronger than Andalusia, but I haven‚Äôt visited Madrid yet.


3. I‚Äôm considering renting an apartment in M√°laga, where prices for basic rentals are around ‚Ç¨700‚Äì800 per month, based on my recent searches.



Before starting the business, I would obviously secure locations for the machines first. I‚Äôd call and negotiate with gyms, malls, or other high-traffic areas to get permission to place the vending machines. Only once I have a solid location in place would I actually buy the machines.

One thing to note: I know many people might suggest E-commerce, dropshipping, or starting an online agency, but that‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm looking to do.

I‚Äôve already tried starting a marketing agency before and realized it‚Äôs not for me.

I don‚Äôt enjoy sales, and I‚Äôve had bad experiences with aggressive sales tactics in the past, which makes me hesitant to get into that side of things.

E-commerce can be risky. A friend of mine once burned ‚Ç¨10,000 on unsuccessful marketing for an E-commerce store, and I‚Äôd rather not go down that path without extensive experience.


I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on this plan! Do you think it‚Äôs a good approach, or is there a better way to invest the ‚Ç¨10,000 to ensure I can build a significant and sustainable income in the future?","It's not a lot of money in the grand scheme. Stick it in a high interest savings account and use it as your foundation to take bigger risks.

Don't touch it unless you're about to go homeless. That level of confidence will let you do things you'd never normally consider. Vending machines take a lot of time to do well...

you will not scale to thirty of them with a full time job unless you hire help. if i have 10k i will put it all in black I launched an e-commerce business with $5,000 and made $25,000 in 10 months. 

This type of business is straightforward and is all about hard work, hustle and opportunity. I have some skills which help me with it. 

I don‚Äôt need to explain the business model. It‚Äôs straightforward.

www.CheapCoolCaps.com Interesting tactic, i like it! How are you planning on securing the spots for the machines? Bitcoin I recommend real estate crowdfunding in Malaga or Madrid, tourism is doing very well there.
> You're aiming for a short-term investment strategy via real estate crowdfunding:
>  * Renovation and ""flip"" projects (or ""quick resale after renovation""): These projects involve acquiring a property, quickly renovating it, and reselling it for a profit. They are well suited to a short-term horizon because the project duration is generally short (from a few months to a maximum of 2 years). Look for platforms that offer this type of operation. The goal is to generate a quick profit through the revaluation of the property.
> Regarding automatic distributors (or ""automatic investment features""), I don't really believe in them, but why not if you have thoroughly studied your market. An assumption that you are working on is that - there is a demand for vending machines type business in an area that you are going to be a newbie. My sense is that vending machine businesses tend to do well in Metro type of cities ( you need a certain type of crowd traffic to make it work) if your city has that then I think there is a good way to make it work. Also doss your target city have the required maintenance folks for regular upkeep.

All the best, a friend of mine had this going pre pandemic and was fairly successful üëç 10k is a good amount but it's not enough for you to have any strong investment to live off.

I would do 2 things: 

1) Put it in an index fund

2) Find a small business to invest in. You can invest in coaching and mentoring. You can be the middle man because the middle man makes the most money. And then you can work on finding clients I would say, invest 30% of it first, in whatever suits, like index stocks, gold or whatever. You dont need to be an expert, just invest in S&P  or something similar. And leave it there! with the balance start a business. 

Vending machine business is nice especially if you are able to put them in offices or waiting areas. Do the business that you are interested in too! Businesses like print on demand, Amazon KDP are good if you are able to market them well. 

Cheers and all the best I would put 10k on red üòÄ In my personal experience, I think it is not a large amount of money to invest and expect a super return, rather I would put that ‚Ç¨10,000 in Cryptocurrency Stacks $STX, then do Stacking through Binance (centralized exchange) or through the non-wallet Xverse custodian, which has that function without intermediaries, in this way I would earn 9-10% APY on my investment, which is received in satoshis ($BTC). This way your investment makes you earn BTC twice a month. If the price of Stacks and/or Bitcoin rises then you increase your capitalization of both your initial investment and what you get month to month in BTC. If you give me ‚Ç¨10,000¬†I will tell you Man, I love your optimism. it seems very good, but did you think about spain mentality, the country is not as rich as germany, so if your price was based on what you see in germany, it will not function. what about just start...Just do it... start with something...it might not work at first time.... consider blowing of some money... its like pay to play Boring businesses will be booming in 2025 Happy to give free advice on the digital marketing side of things. I'm not selling anything BTW, just wanna help. From Germany to Spain‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
Trust me Spain is only good for holidays Yolo on GME probably, dont pay me too much attention though jaja, only invest what you are willing to lose, if so, dew it, it has insane risk, but IF it goes well, well, you would be substantially richer. I'd throw it from the 8th floor to see how far it travels and who picks it up Good for you, wish you all the best of luck.

If you ever want to invest in something digital (like a website, or app...) we can connect and have a meeting, this way you can get a broad idea and I can practice my English Invest in my business (marketing, events) ETFs (I don‚Äôt have a business) And you will end up red, of anger üò° nice work more on your keyword for seo optimisations this is dope! so simple, but effective. willing to share more? Nice job! I've noticed a little typo in the about section -   
""We only buy new things i we really need it""-I guess the the 'i' was supposed to be 'if' This is a different type of E commerce and yes brand e-commerce are more likely to succeed.

If you have the right product.

If he savy, he can do all the logo and web designing himself and invest 5k in influencer marketing. Bitcoin is for saving and storing your economic energy. It does not have any yield, and OP needs a cash flow. Also, it‚Äôs very volatile, so OP might suddenly have 6k one day and 12k the next.

I love Bitcoin, but it does not solve OP‚Äôs problem here. I would put as much of that 10k as I could afford to in BTC. Without question. What‚Äôs better than Bitcoin ? More Bitcoin.
I would buy Bitcoin with that 10k. And then Borrow 5k with those BTC as collat√©ral.
And I will use those 5k cash to buy more Bitcoin. its too risky but your lucky you can win Exactly Your comment might get down voted though. People still think its a Ponzi, or that it has no intrinsic value, or all of the other straw man arguments against bitcoin.

Any peice of advise will be appreciated ","We are in the same shoes, and I've decided to keep going  (i was going to drop out). It's your choice and its a hard decision to make I'd advise on getting the degree and agrue ""look at all that made it and had to take a degree later on"". It also eases your partners and investors that ""you have a piece of paper that says you at least have somewhat of a clue what you're doing"" unless you want to lone wolf it.

It can even be an introduction on joining someone else's start-up as colleges and universities often have big start-up communities. I think you need to decide what field you want to be in.  ""Entrepreneur"" isn't a field, it's just a role within the business.  Do you want to be in tech, healthcare, trash pickup, retail, etc?  Then get a degree in that field.  Then you'll most likely work in the field for some period of time, and then you'll have the knowledge and experience to start your own business in it. If you‚Äôre planning on getting a degree then I would get it in something that‚Äôs related to the type of business you want to start and what investors or clients would potentially look for. Ex: if you want to create a business on teaching kids to code then it would be helpful if you knew how to code and had a degree CS. If you want to be a financial planner then a degree in finance/experience in finance could be helpful. 

If you need an investor, I would consider what type of knowledge an investor would feel is important to invest in your company.

If you don‚Äôt need an investor, I would consider what type of knowledge a customer would feel is importantly to trust and want to work with you.

If you have no idea, try asking people/people that are already in the field/entrepreneurship journey that you want to be at. Yep its a hard choice , that's why i need more thoughts on this So, investing money in education is worth it? even though zero interest is working as an actual engineer in the field? I think you'd struggle getting an engineer degree without interest(as the calculus can be killer), but a business degree(or it) will definitely be good padding even though it might be a few years out of date.

Remember, it's all about how to present/sell yourself to others and gain their trust. And that degree can certainly be worth more to the right people than experience (investors and future colleagues/employees).

Think of it it as ""who would you trust to work for/with"".",2025-01-15 05:37:00

It took off, and in the end we made 6 figures from it quite quickly.

That process of JV laun",,avoid,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i1th6a/how_do_you_find_a_business_partner/,How do you find a business partner?,"Hi all, I ran a small marketing & automation gig by myself and recently let one of my long-term friends join for the past 3 months. We're based in Denmark.  
  
He is in the same industry and knows how everything works, so I thought, hey, two hands are better than 1.   
  
I love having an extra person in the office and spar on ideas and I personally am in a much happier place that what I was before. 

The problem is: I don't feel like he is dedicated enough. It's almost like work-wise, it slows me down because it is literally faster for me to fix whatever he is doing myself, than to wait for him.   
  
Same thing with discipline. Last time I saw this amount of sick days and ""traffic delays"" was in high-school. It annoys me because he 9/10 times put his excuses on something external and I feel like he is bullshitting me. When I tell him he get's defensive.

I have come to the conclusion that either I am just overly rushing everything, or I need to find another business parther. So with that:

1. Is it okay to be completely obsessed with moving the company forward?

2. How would I go about finding a hungry high achiever locally?

Still somewhat new to this game so I have a ton to learn in regards to partnerships. Let me hear your thoughts and personal experiences.","Finding a business partner is like finding a life partner it has to click. If your friend isn‚Äôt keeping up, it‚Äôs okay to reevaluate. You‚Äôre not wrong to want someone as driven as you are, especially when it‚Äôs your business on the line. I‚Äôd suggest checking out local networking events or even LinkedIn groups for entrepreneurs in Denmark. Look for someone who genuinely shares your vision, not just someone who can fill a role. You‚Äôve got this! Personally I try to avoid doing business with people from my private life. I have many great friends but none of them that I would like to run a business with. Ofcourse there are exceptions to this rule, if you both genuinely share the same passion and drive, but that's rare.

When you say you ""let him join"", what does that mean? Is he employed? Did you offer equity? Or a subcontrator?  You can not excpect a person who's getting paid as an employee to have the same incentives as you. Think about incentives, they matter, a lot.

Furthermore I would say trust your gut when it comes to hiring people and seeking business partners. If it doesn't feel right from the start, it's not going to get better. Skills can be acquired, personal ambition and drive can't. You're certainly not alone with this - I feel it's something everyone has to go through at some point. 

No, it's not ""okay"" to be completely obsessed with moving the company forward - it's critical (and yes, I stole that quote üòâ). 

And as you've already noticed, it's incredibly hard to find someone with the same drive. After all, why should they? It's not their baby as much as it is yours, and it never will. This is much easier when you're starting together from scratch, but adding another person later is tough. 

You can either fire him right away, but you could also ask yourself what your expectations were towards him in the first place. Were you looking for a business partner (somebody with skin in the game) or somebody to do the work? Have you told him clearly what you expect? 

Once you get clear about why you wanted him in the company in the first place, it will be much easier to decide if you want to keep him around - and chances are, he'll be grateful for you to articulate precisely what you want from him. avoid friends and relatives in business, and if you need a partner I'm interested tho. For me this happened through work. I was a freelancer writing apps for peoples startup ideas and martech stuff. A client asked me to write a WordPress plugin but didn't have a massive budget. I'd already done a few jobs for the guy and I got on well with him (it clicked, like some others have said here).

I offered to build the thing for some cash and then launch it on a marketplace and share the proceeds. 

It took off, and in the end we made 6 figures from it quite quickly.

That process of JV launching a test project was invaluable in me seeing how he works, how we'd work together, and what each of us could bring to a united company.

The rest is history, we went on to make loads of software together, the last one we exited to market leader for a modest but meaningful amount.

In hindsight I'd say:
- Find someone who clicks
- Find someone who is smarter than you in some aspects
- Find someone who will put in the work (commit to labour) reliably for forseeable future
- Find someone who has the skills you lack, or is able/keen to learn them
- Experiment: trial a project with them, see how it goes, trial another etc.

Years later we're still close friends, even with the ups and downs of our friendship as comes with going through a fairly big exit into a bigger corp. 

Last note: I think friendship matters in all of it, and attitude more than anything.

Good luck :) Best way imo is volume. Meet a bunch of people, and be patient. When you least expect, the right fit will present itself. You‚Äôre not wrong to want someone as driven as you. To find a high achiever, network in local entrepreneurial meetups, coworking spaces, or LinkedIn groups in Denmark. People who show up to these places are already hustlers, and you can vibe-check them before diving into a partnership. Partnerships mostly never work out youre better off hiring an employee. I‚Äôm stuck with the same situation. I sometimes look for an other me person. 

You‚Äôre not rushing, you‚Äôre a performer and you expect the same. Let me tell you something, he‚Äôs not you. You need to find another business partner who thinks like you.

Sense of urgency gets work done. yeah, I am thinking of same things right now, I am starting an marketing agency in Romania and the guy I want to do it with, is not a close friend, have some experience, but I feel that I need someone to be hungry like me.. If there isn't discipline, you better ditch that guy asap There are many ways to find a perfect and ambitious business partner. There are many platforms, which offers you people that also want to start a startup and earn money. The problem is nowadays you have to pay for most of the communities and you can also have the misfortune that nobody wants to start in this niche with you. Finding the right partner is less about convenience and more about alignment. Look for someone who not only matches your ambition but is willing to go through the grind with you. Networking events, industry meetups, or even startup communities (online or offline) could be a good start.

Most importantly, don‚Äôt rush it. A great partner is like a co-pilot‚Äîyou want someone who‚Äôs just as invested in the journey as you are. Never work with friends or family.

End the current arrangement and be clear about the reason. 

Stalk the internet for new partners. It takes a while to see what they are like, so run a few jobs through them before discussing any idea of partnership.

You have learned a brilliant lesson, and not too expensive this time! 

Lee Finding a business partner is difficult, because people change, life changes and the needs on the company too change. It might be too much of wishful thinking to want everybody to feel the same way as you about a company. 

Moreover, judgements are mostly feelings too. Have your partner verbally said he is not that interested in moving the company forward?

Have a sincere and open conversation with him about the work he is putting in. Also, set goals to be acheived in your agreement to unblock % of the company or to get higher pay. Yes, it's fine to be fully dedicated to moving your business forward, but ensure your partner shares the same commitment. To find a high-achiever locally, network within your industry, attend business events, and leverage platforms like LinkedIn or startup incubators. i thinks you can cantact people you know on the social media When finding a partner, try to focus on finding someone who aligns with your values and work ethic, not just skills. You could try networking at local business events or co-working spaces and start with smaller collaborations to test compatibility. Best advice we can give is to make sure you trust your gut. is it worse to have a business partner, if your business start to grow and you have a different vision of the futur ? how it works ? It seems like you're doing it all on your own. Why share? Cool story bro. Thank you! I am currently looking in those groups and read here that extreme sports might have the same kind of go-getter people, so maybe that's a place to find these guys as well. Let him join as in we made a piece of paper saying we split everything moving forward 50/50. So new clients' profits are split 50/50. You're right about the incentives part. And yes trusting my gut is what I am leaning towards now. He's cool and all but it trips me out that I don't know if he is even gonna show up when we have things to do. I would love to connect, I myself am looking for partner to go into government contracting with. what do you do? I have found my business partner in school, because we didn't want to work for others when we have great ideas which we can work on and then sell to others. I am still happy to have him as my business partner, because we each other push each other to limits we didn't we have. Dich him pronto! what for? to start bidding on government opportunities, federal and state, if they have a set-aside that would be a plus too",2025-01-15 04:04:22

6. Now you start thinking about the outbound infra  ;-)



No matter what outbound method you'll be using (cold calling, cold email, DMs etc) what you're looking for is effective stimuli that you can deply in front of people that would generate the desire",effective,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i1t68l/arent_the_services_that_i_offer_in_need_or_am_i/,"Aren't the services that I offer in need, or am I doing something wrong?","I'm a data automation specialist hitting a wall with cold outreach, and I need your insights.After sending 400 cold emails (200 local, 200 international) offering services like:

* PowerBI dashboard development
* Advanced Google Sheets automation with AppScript
* Manual data entry automation
* Custom reporting solutions

Result? One single ""thanks"" reply. That's it.I know these services solve real business problems - who hasn't struggled with messy spreadsheets or manual data entry? But clearly, I'm missing something in my approach.For those of you running businesses:

* Where do you actually look when you need these kinds of services?
* If you're using Google Sheets or dealing with data entry, what are your current pain points?
* Am I completely off base with cold emailing as an approach?

Would love to hear your experiences and advice on connecting with businesses that could benefit from these solutions.","It's all a numbers game. Email spammers send hundreds of thousands of emails. But it's an art. From setting up an infrastructure to warming up email boxes.  But hey, you are an automation expert - automate it! Call them insted? Who cares about a random email? Introduce yourself and try to set up a quick meeting over a cup of coffe If someone you‚Äôre trying to sell to doesn‚Äôt see or feel they have a problem, why would they buy a solution? You need to build on the value your automation brings. What problems are you solving for your clients I'm sorry to hear you're not seeing results. It could be down to your offer. Do you research each business/ person you send your cold emails to and personalise your email? 

This is where I would start: 

\- spend 15-20 mins on research and copy mining 

\- based on this, create 2-3 different offers that target specific groups with specific pain points

\- keyword optimization (this is so that you start attracting clients instead of chasing them)

\- make sure to send your emails from a business email (get a domain and set one up on Gmail). Any other email provider will lend your emails in a spam folder. And I'm sure that's not where you want to be. 

\- keywords are your friend, even if you just include them in your LinkedIn profile. If you need further help, don't hesitate to drop me a message. Hope this helps. I‚Äôve been in business for 30 years and not sure what you‚Äôre offering. Maybe it‚Äôs your delivery.  What problem are you solving for me? 390 of them got deleted without even being opened.  9 of them opened it, read some of it, and then deleted it.  1 cordially responded to you.  Generally speaking, no, I don't think cold emails typically work unless the subject line tells me it's got potential to really benefit me.



I'm in healthcare.  I pay 140 dollars per syringe for a certain medicine, I use 10-15 of them a week.  I got an email with the subject line ""Drug XYZ for $60"".  I opened that one.  I bought a ton from them.  That one worked.  

  
Are your services in need?  My business, no, I don't need your services, I don't do a lot of data entry, and when I do, it's in specialized software that my industry uses.  How did you choose the 400 businesses to email?  My point is, if you got the email I mentioned above, you would've deleted it immediately.  I lit up.  In medicine, we refer to it as ""pretest probability"".  If you only run a test on people who really probably have the disease, your chance of a false positive is very low.  If you only email real potential clients, your success rate will be much higher. Actually you don't have a solid offer. Many of them don't even know about your service and how it can help them in a long run and can actually save them good money. 

Research on your offer. 

Focus on these:

1. Make personalized approach. Get their direct attention through catchy subject line. 

2. Curious them from headline and then deliver your offer in one sentence. 

3. Make your profile and website only around your ICP. Your target audience should feel like that you talk about them only. 

If B2B then approach on linkedIn. It's best platform for the same. We're booking 15+ appointments for our client. Try it with dedication and let me know your results then. Well, I could maybe speak days about the topic.

Some Missing Pieces (sequential):

1. Audience - good understanding of your audience pain points, desired outcomes, psychological conditions ==> this gives your input for relevant offer creation

2. Offer design - outcomes based (see Hormozi's 100M Offers) => relevance will come from #1

3. Work for FREE =-> Build Previous Experience + Testimonials (2-3)

4. Results => will come from #3, assuming you grind & hussle & you'll adapt to improve where your market needs you to improve

5. Confidence that you can deliver => will come from #4

6. Now you start thinking about the outbound infra  ;-)



No matter what outbound method you'll be using (cold calling, cold email, DMs etc) what you're looking for is effective stimuli that you can deply in front of people that would generate the desired action (for example a reply to your email). This is rooted more into psychology, than into objective reality of your tooling / activities and ROI/TCO. Yes, you'll be choosing your outbound method based on the audience you're looking to contact; for example, if they're not on social media, how could you use DMs effectively as an outbound method? And yes, volume of activity is ALSO important. Say you want 2 meetings per day, and you get a good reply than converts to a meeting from 1 prospect in 100 emails sent, then you'll need to send 200 emails per day. So it's both, volume & quality (relevance, positioning, copywriting etc). Making a sale is just a chain of stimuli deployed at certain stages to progress prospects to the next step.

For your outbound efforts to be eficient you'll need to know a good amount of Psychometrics details of your audience so you can design and deploy stimuli with higher chances of conversion. That's why it is important to niche down, because you're constantly looking to find out and understand well / better a set of common traits and characteristics of your audience - otherwise you're shooting blanks...

Offer - you offer would do much better if you would talk about pains & problems and how your offer would alleviate this pain & how you would deliver the desired outcomes, instead brining the tools you're using, the activities involved and so forth in front. For example, if you would be selling a mattress - you communicate first about good sleep & great health benefits, not the production process or the materials.

One HUGE benefit that you'll want to leverage - your BI finished work has high visual impact potential (think dashboards, visualizations, graphs etc). People are responding well to what they can ""see"". You'll want to leverage that AND to connect it with the outcomes that those nice ""visual"" things can deliver.

  
How would I start - I would pick a niche that has 25,000 - 50,000 prospect clients. Interview 20-30 of them to understand their pains, what they're trying to achieve and why it's important. I would offer to help 2-3 of them for free and they'll offer me feedback on what works, what doesn't and where my service could potentially be improved + a testimonial once they're wowed. I would then start charging leveraging my built confidence into what I can deliver + testimonials. Repeat, improve the service, gradually increase the price. Once demand > delivery capacity you can charge lots more.

  
Hope that helps Former cold emailer here. your problem isn't your services, it's your approach. cold email is basically dead for B2B these days unless you have serious volume and infrastructure. try LinkedIn instead  join industry groups, share actual automation tips/mini case studies, and connect with people who engage. you'll get way better results than cold spraying emails. Yeah, I have and will never buy anything for my business from someone that cold e-mails me.

It wasn‚Äôt fancy or anything‚Äîjust him initially, connecting with students wanting to learn English as a second language. He started small, just using Zoom and some basic curriculum he put together. But pretty quickly, word-of-mouth brought him more students, and he had to bring in a couple more tutors.

The trick for him was focusing on what makes the learning experience unique. He‚Äôd combine language skills with cultural context, which students learned from him personally, and that really appealed to them. Also, online groups on social media platforms are great for marketing without much cost. More so for education-related stuff, posting short learning tips, videos, and even memes, when done well, really gets you some right kind of attention.

You don‚Äôt",great,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i1prqh/becoming_an_important_person/,Becoming an important person.,"I am 21 years old, I recently started a pressure washing business. I want to use this business as a stepping stool to begin to make real money so I can go to actual networking events with the vip tickets that are $900. I right now I work at amazon while I build the business. I want to become one of those people who always have to wear suits every where because they don‚Äôt waste time or money etc Myron Golden, Jordan Peterson, Elon Musk, you get the idea. 

How can I network properly? 
I have a couple apps downloaded but I don‚Äôt think these people need a pressure washer ( maybe real estate agents ) a lot of people are in Tech. 

What hobbies do successful people do? 
My mentor told me I am the some of the 5 people I hang out with. Where do I find people who are on higher level than me? Super car meets? Do wealthy people enjoy orchestras and classical music plays? I know some play golf but I suck at golf and am not in a country club.
  
Skills
What skills are a must that I can work on while I work and build my business so I can be able to have multiple uses for other people and not just one?  

Reading & podcast 
I don‚Äôt read much but I have started watching a lot of podcast so I can think different and have different point of views is this a waste of time? Thanks","Hey OP, congrats on the start up! I vividly recall having some very similar thoughts 7 years ago when I was around the same age. 

I did the same thing and downloaded networking and meetup apps. I was fortunate at that time to meet really successful people that I aspired to be and remember thinking to myself how it had looked like they had more opportunities presented to them on a daily basis then they could handle, while I was actively going out and trying to seek opportunities and the experience taught me humility and created the sense of aspiration that I think you might be feeling as well. 

Fast forward to today ‚Äî though I‚Äôm still no where near where I want to be, im at state now where my reality is that I have more presented to me than I can handle. As far as getting here, what I can confidently tell you is that none of those apps I had downloaded, and by association, the strategies I found online about networking groups had resulted in anything meaningful for me *personally* (YMMV). 


Rather, I built my skill sets and network through thousands of hours of *trying new things* and *actually doing stuff* - here are some very tangible examples:
- I worked with developers to build apps that ended up flopping
- I learned website development by actually going out and creating a website
- I learned marketing by watching and listening to hundreds of hours of social media marketing strategies and designing things on platforms like canva, and testing them out and studying others  
- I learned finance through hundreds of hours of podcasts, YouTube videos, and reading, and started working on building proforma and budget templates that align with my needs 
- I learned operations and systems development  through thousands of hours adapting and automating systems and processes within my business
- I learned HR through over one hundred difficult conversations/managing interpersonal conflicts/hiring/firing/performance management and improvement. 

Through all of these, I ended up finding that my strength is in operations, which embodies all of the aforementioned. 

Ultimately, the greatest lesson here that I‚Äôm trying to do convey is that though the podcast you listen to or the project or business idea you work on *today* may not pan out or may not be relevant to you in this season, each experience will contribute towards shaping the person you will be in the future, even if you don‚Äôt have that immediate foresight on what that looks like. 

As such, my personal opinion is to just do what you‚Äôre doing and go out and try new things, dabble in different areas of business and find what sticks out to you then double down on that. You don‚Äôt become ""important"" just by wearing suits or attending exclusive events.
While those things can enhance your image, the key lies in staying authentic and valuing yourself. Remember, you‚Äôre not defined by your net worth but by the expertise, experiences, and unique perspective you bring to the table. Confidence in who you are is what truly sets you apart. It‚Äôs not about being important, it‚Äôs about solving peoples problems. You can become important to someone by solving a problem of theirs. Thats it Keep grinding on that biz man! I can tell you‚Äôre ambitious which is good. The important part of providing value and being ‚Äúimportant‚Äù is to break down things into the fundamentals. What as a person can you uniquely provide to the world? E.g. Jordan Peterson is highly specialised in psychology and is a very strong communicator so he is able to help people with complex psychological problems. Elon Musk can build companies with technological innovation to solve problems.

Networking is usually a waste of time in comparison to spending that time working on yourself because no one will care about you if you don‚Äôt solve a problem or offer something valuable so it‚Äôs a better use of time to become a more intelligent thinker and decision maker. To learn more about business and how to solve problems. Eventually your reputation and skill will precede you and you won‚Äôt need to network as others will want to work with you. I would recommend not doing a hobby purely to advance your business life. Don‚Äôt spend so much time improving your life that you forget to live. You can have hobbies just for fun.

I fully respect your ambition and your pursuit to make something of yourself. Check out Naval Ravikant. He is a highly accomplished entrepreneur and investor who has taught me a lot. Aspiring to be any of those people isn't helpful. Man If I could go back to 21, and read posts from elders. 

Look, you need to do a few things before proceeding..

First, you may be in business now for money, but that won‚Äôt last, you need to focus on solving problems. 

Second, networking is free is most situations, it‚Äôs ok to pay for expos and conventions once you have disposable income. 

Third, if it won‚Äôt make you money, or make you smarter, don‚Äôt buy it, and if you still want to buy it, wait 72 hours, if you think you don‚Äôt need it anymore, don‚Äôt buy it. Only buy something you can buy 3x with cash, lose it all, and not regret it, this goes for all things in life. 

Fourth, your motivation and drive to succeed with get worn down, however this is reality for all, your choice will be to hunker down and quit, or hunker down and find a way to solve your own problem(s)

Five, you‚Äôre going to lose a lot of people in your circle, this includes family, friends, buddies, other business owners locally, this is ok, it‚Äôs part of the system. 

Six, if it was easy everyone would be a business owner. 

My suggestion is to donate some labor to a local school, church, community group, and that‚Äôs your advertising for your good graces to the community, donate money during the holidays to local charities, feed the homeless, there is so many good things in the world you can change on your own, you just have to want it more than most. 

Find your why, adjust, and never quit. 

Good luck kid, I‚Äôm rooting for you. 

-the guy who ran a very successful residential painting and pressure washing business. I would spend $200 on FB business/instagram ads displaying before/after pictures plus a way for them to schedule and pay online (preferably your website if you have one.)

If that is not an option, I would go to every house within a really really short distance of your home base saving you time and money, then work your way to the wealthiest part of town/city and you‚Äôll find someone that will spread the word for you. Once you have the income, spend 20-30% on marketing all around, business cards, ads, radio, tv, apparel, logo vehicle, etc. 

Option 3 should be included for some portion of your time going to real estate meetups talking with landlords/investors/contractors, chatting with local realtors in the area you want to work in. If you want to clean vehicles, start with the person you know closest to you with the nicest car, or nicest house, if you want to get into commercial, find them, and ask them for help growing your business. take awesome pictures, be genuine and continue to educate yourself and others and it will grow as much or as little as you want. 

Finally, ALWAYS ask for a referral, even if that person doesn‚Äôt buy from you, they probably know someone who does, for the person that did buy from you, if you met or exceeded or even failed their expectations word will travel, fast in todays world. 

You got this. Aweseome, how did you find like Hr, operations, & website designing? Did you just do courses or did you work for a company that had all of those things? True thank you Thanks bro! Thanks for the input that makes a lot of sense actually. That‚Äôs why I love reddit I always look at forums to see older people‚Äôs opinions and advice it helps a lot. I didn‚Äôt grow up in church nobody in my family goes to church but I just recently started, I love it! I‚Äôm going to go donate all my small clothes today. Also Since you‚Äôve ran a pressure washing business I have a question. I pass out 100-250 cards a day with a quoted price door to door, what else can I do to grow? Thank you so much. You just gave me so much information that gave me even more motivation. I don‚Äôt have a website yet but I‚Äôm going to make or pay for someone to make one. Hey OP, I ran different start ups and became an owner in a brick and mortar which I ended up scaling to over $6M in rev. As you scale any business, you have to very quickly learn HR, operations etc as it becomes the nature of keeping the business alive and thriving. How much business are you getting from 150-200 cards a day, and how many hours is this taking you/how many days a week?

What are you charging to pressure wash a single story home and what‚Äôs included with that wash if I called you today for a quote and when can you come do it? It takes me about 1 hour per 100 cards so 2.5 hours if I do 250. I started doing this 5x a week I don‚Äôt really get any business from doing cards but it‚Äôs how I keep marketing myself. I had 1500 cards I‚Äôve gotten 2 calls so far and im about half way through my stack. I write quotes for the driveways so a 2 car driveway I put $60 for a 3 car I put $75. For a single story I put 150-180",2025-01-14 23:41:15

....I was so excited leading up to this, and now I'm nervous AF lol. 

Fortunately I have a really good coach who walked me through the whole process of starting my business including forming a tangible idea. Having someone successful by my side in a similar type of work has been immensely helpful. I honestly think it was because of her. I was able to get off the ground.

Keep us updated. [removed] Congratulations dude, all the best! Keep us updated on the journey! It's wonderful that you have someone trustworthy by your side. Even when there aren't any obvious problems or pressing situations, having a reliable teammate helps distribute the pressure(or doubt or fear), making things easier in both the short and long run!

It keeps you on track and makes things feel more manageable. Trust the process, and don‚Äôt rush it! How did you go about starting your business? as thinking of setting up my own Congratulations on launching ! You have a great opportunity here to promote a community of people that will follow you.

It's gonna be very important that you remember to serve first. Especially if you start making an income from your business.

Foster, a community of people that you can help and go from there. People will talk about you and bring other people into the community that you can help.

I'm also here to help you.So if you need anything, don't be afraid to DM me with questions that you might have.

Good luck my friend üòÅ Good look! Launch and launch again Good luck brother, text me if you need hard honest opinion Congrats and good luck!

At some points that would've described her job accurately lol. Thanks! Will do. Yes, I'm pretty sure this would be much more taxing if she wasn't by my side Thank you for this. I decided to create some kind of schedule overall, starting from tomorrow (today since posting), so that I can remain organized. Before I go into what may be a long drawn out explanation, I am currently a sole proprietor. My coach suggested I wait until I've been doing the work before I become an LLC. 

**I initially doubted this advise, but took it anyway. She was right. At the very last minute I actually pivoted away from my initial business plan and I am now doing work that is slightly different than I set out to do. Explanation below**

In early 2024 I took a number of business courses (let me know if you'd like those resources as they were reputable*and* free). But I realized something was missing.

I realized I needed help. So I got a business coach. It was serendipity because the coach I wanted was actually launching her beta program. So, I was able to get her service for a fraction of what it would typically cost.

Tbh, this is not the first time I embarked on this endeavor. At the very beginning of the pandemic, I had my initial launch, but my business idea was slightly different (health coaching). It kind of fizzled out because my day job was keeping me busy, well paid, and happy enough. I also was operating as a sole proprietor, so there was nothing to dissolve.

After a layoff in late 2023, that's when I started taking business classes and reinvesting in my coaching business. Not sure how people here feel about this particular industry, but I had gone to school and paid tuition for a certification. I also wanted to do this type of work. So I figured it made sense to keep that going to at least get some kind of return on that investment.

Once it was time to launch I was hit with the inspiration for another idea...dance classes. I'm already a dancer and I've taught in the past so it may seem obvious, however for me it wasn't because that's not my particular dream lol.

But thanks to my  coach (I know I keep mentioning her but I promise this is not an advertisement. It really is a testament to how I needed help. And she addressed the ""I don't know what I don't know"" parts of business)...I made an effortless pivot into teaching under the umbrella my initial business idea, which fortunately I can come back to when the timing is right.

I actually made another pivot, into something more niche, which is why it took me so long to get back to this post. I am now offering dance classes for an even more specific population.

I've been super busy because 1. Being visible via my launch has gotten me side quests and gig offerings that I was not expecting 2. Within 12 hours of my first ad I've gotten feedback. So now I'm going my sales abilities.

Umm, I hope that helps?

A tangible tip I can offer is that market research can be done by putting something out on the market and seeing what feedback you get. For example advertising your product and service allows you to collect information in real time as opposed to looking at statistics fron 3 years ago via some resource. While the books and databases are helpful, they are not dynamic. For example, dance teachers in my city are a dime a dozen, however the difference in my service is my expertise, network and reputation, which is why I was commissioned to teach within 3 days of my launch. I could not anticipate that response and statistics don't account for that. Service. Dance lessons. I agree! Best of luck!",2025-01-14 21:37:50

Create profiles of your business on all the social networks that exist and advertise with photos of your work, pay for advertising, etc. Walk to the oldest middle-income neighborhood in the city and start talking to folks who need painting done.

If the neighborhood has a ton of old houses next to each other - do one house at cost, but put flyers ads everywhere, give bunch of cards to the owner,  talk to neighbors during the work, and have your car washed and branded like a Christmas tree.

Question ",,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i1kiot/i_will_absolutely_be_rich_one_day/,I will absolutely be rich one day. ,"I'm a 23 year old college student that works full time while attending classes. I've worked at a storage facility for around a year. Before I worked here, I thought that I'd go to school, get my degree, and work a 9-5 making 100-160k a year and be happy. Working here has completely changed my outlook on life.

Often times I get average customer (or assholes), but sometimes I meet people that are super inspiring and interesting. I've gotten personalized advice and exchanged contact information with CEO's of energy companies, automobile manufacturers, trucking companies, house flippers, oil company sales directors, etc. The types of people that make over 500k a year. I've been offered a business broker job.

I've realized that these people are normally happy to chat and share advice, such as how they started, around how much they make a year, problems they've encountered, recommendations for me. They normally say finish school and use the income to start something of my own. Maybe they see themselves in me.

There is no way that I will work a 9-5 for the rest of my life. I understand the security and comfort that people get from it, but I want greater in life. I'm absolutely materialistic, but I don't think it's a nasty word as some people use it. I like nice things. Within the last year of working here, ive began reselling. I've been pretty profitable on FBA, Ebay, Facebook Marketplace. But I need to scale up, I need something more official and consistent.

I want the freedom to say ""Fuck it, I think ill book a flight to Japan today"", and not have to worry about things like a boss telling me whether or not I can go or if I have enough money saved up. I hate the feeling of being sleepy in the morning, but having to drag myself out of bed to keep my 18.50/hr job (though it's a great job  as a student). Seeing my dad work a job that was harsh on his body for over 20 years, just to recently start making $150k/yr has inspired me to be better.

I started this semester classes yesterday, and my engineering graphics teacher was saying ""You guys want this degree so you can get a good job, work for a good company, and after 30 to 40 years, retire"". It scared me a bit. That sounded terrible! Making another person richer and richer. Fuck that. Humans live for around 77 years on average, and I need to make the most of it. I've already wasted years of my life dicking around for 4 years after highschool at a shitty job. I'm just glad this revelation has occurred to me now. 

I'll be finishing up my ME degree over the next few years, and in the mean time saving as much money as I can. I'm not super sure what I'll do exactly. I've been interested in house hacking, and could see myself buying a duplex while renting out the other half, and selling after a few years to reinvest in larger properties. I'll continue asking every customer that comes in for advice, and if they do any kinds of business or investments. I've learned not to judge a person by what they wear or drive. Some of the richest people I've met drove a basic ass car. People you could google.

Maybe I'll start a company of some sorts, I have no idea. I've gotten advice in the meantime to open up an LLC and a business credit card and make super tiny transactions on it, so when I have my ""big-boy job"", ill have a larger credit line. I think I'll use this next year at this job to network with as many people as possible, maintain my high GPA, and continue developing skills during downtime, like programming.

If anybody has life / financial advice stories they'd be willing to share I'd appreciate it. My DM's are open. Seriously, I may be willing to send like 5 bucks or so to people that offer seriously good advice or experience. Good luck everybody.","I would say this.¬†

If money is your end goal you will not be rich one day most likely. Every business I did for money never worked out.¬†

If you get a high off earning money for something you created or did as opposed to renting your time AND you still get this feeling if you were making 30k a year then there‚Äôs a good chance you may be ‚Äúrich‚Äù one day.¬† RemindMe! 20 years Before you start worshipping money, start looking for problems you would like to solve. You sound super ambitious and that‚Äôs great, but let me give it to you straight. First off, thinking you're gonna get rich just because you rub elbows with CEO types is kinda naive. Networking is cool and all, but those people aren't gonna hand you a multibillion dollar business plan on a silver platter, you know? And let‚Äôs be real, the whole ‚Äúquit your 9-5‚Äù dream is sold by people who want you to buy their $999 ‚Äúget rich quick‚Äù course. Most CEOs worked their butts off in jobs they didn‚Äôt love before they struck gold.

Also, this idea that you're wasting life if you work a 9-5 is just crap. It‚Äôs not about what hours you work‚Äîit‚Äôs what you do. Some people love that and are making a difference, and you sound like you should be more open to that. It‚Äôs cool to want money and stuff, nobody‚Äôs saying don‚Äôt, but romanticizing ‚Äúcompany of some sorts‚Äù without knowing anything concrete is foggy thinking. Get a solid plan before you start talking about buying flights to Japan on a whim.

And offering cash for advice? Dude, save your money! Good advice often comes free, just not those too-rich-to-be-true stories. You‚Äôre still young, the world isn't gonna go anywhere while you figure stuff out. Stay hungry but be smart about it. Also, pro tip: engineering is super cool and pays well too, don‚Äôt sleep on that as an option! I wish you all the best, but I just want to say:

Life is funny.¬†

Nonetheless, you seem to have a positive attitude towards life, and that‚Äôs a prerequisite for success. I would say don‚Äôt look down on others for working a 9-5. Some people view work as something that pays for their lifestyle outside of work, and nothing more. I‚Äôve met happy people that make very little, and miserable people that make a fortune. Stay humble. Make sure you keep a good head on your shoulder. Money is great, but don‚Äôt forget about family, friends, health, etc.¬† You can do it bro. Let me give you a piece of advice. You can't take time off, you can't relax. You have to fight every day. You have to keep making progress every day. When you fail get back up and try again, and again until something sticks. Take what you learned from your failures and apply to the next iteration. Maybe you‚Äôll be fortunate and the first thing will stick, but if not persist. GL amigo that's what i said at 22, i'm 37 now, i'm not rich money wise, I'm rich with a great family, a nice home. And i'm not doing bad financially either.

In summary, for me it‚Äôs a non stop grind but it‚Äôs taken 9yrs to really pay off in the last 2. Just an FYI, going to Japan isn't *that* expensive. 

Get yourself an Amtrak coach ticket to LA. A one-way ticket to Tokyo on Delta Airlines for Feb 3rd is like 340 bucks. Being in Tokyo is pretty cheap. Enjoy the moment bc life is finite. Save early.. invest and you will find freedom.

I told my boss at 45, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm one argument away from retirement.‚Äù

DO NOT OVER LIVE your life financially.  The compounding effect of investing at 23/25 YO is undeniable. Have faith & keep a burning desire and you‚Äôll accomplish everything you ever wanted & more. work a boring job long enough to get your PE then start your own ME consulting firm.... Youre in the right path. If youre into rubbing elbows with CEOs already, heres a tip I found from one YT influencers to get rich quickly. Set a dinner or lunch with a successfull real estate developer in youre area. Ask for an apprenticeship in his company for free. All you gotta do is pick up his brain, work as hard as you could, learn as much as you could. Work in 6 months-1year appreticeship. By the end of the year, youre going to own your next property. What‚Äôs your foundation look like? How‚Äôs your physical and mental health? 

Those 2 aspects will give you the energy and time you need to be consistent. 

And consistency will be the defining factor of success. No one and I mean NO ONE who is inconsistent is successful. 

I was you 5 years ago. If you want to do a virtual coffee chat and brainstorm shoot me a message! You'll be a sad old man that missed out on life and spend their days drinking at dive bars in the Florida keys in a house you bought so family would visit - but they dont. Uhm, ok.  good luck and someday hope you can get reality check, sooner than later.  

But first, grow up.  You still sound like that elementary kid when asked what they want to do when they grow up: ""An Astronaut!"".  You, ""a multi-millionaire"".  So grow up, be extra productive in a society and money will come.  If not, you're going to be extra depressed pretty soon. The guy that started Waste Management wasn‚Äôt passionate about garbage. Anyone that made a successful business out of HVAC or plumbing? They weren‚Äôt passionate about unclogging toilets and installing duct work in scorching summer attics.¬†

You don‚Äôt need to be passionate about the field of business in order to be successful. Maybe you do, and that‚Äôs perfectly acceptable. I even fall into this camp. But plenty of people like running a business for the sake of running a business. Getting deals, sales, captaining their own ship and figuring out the strategy in their market. Being passionate about your field of business is great but isn‚Äôt required. Very true, money has weird energy to it. If you earn money easily or just for moneys sake, it becomes very weird like you almost don‚Äôt want the money.

Plus making money just for making money will often lead you into lots of problems such as fraud.

The best way is to align your entrepreneurial pursuit with your principles as a human and which is a net benefit to humanity, not just for making money.

|-|-|-|-| So true. I‚Äôm 30 plus with 6 years experience from IT (test automation, programming and software architecture). Currently nowadays working as project management.

I have been dreaming about my super multi million dollar business but i haven‚Äôt had any ‚Äúpassion‚Äù for something specific sector and I‚Äôm not person who start business just because its business. 
I think this change into administrative role has been fresh move for me and who knows if this is my step to move towards becoming entrepreneur. Maybe it is coming sooner or later.

How ever, i think working as project manager is almost like being entrepreneur. At least for me. I have to understand business, know the domain, sell more to the clients and lead people. Something what I would do in my own company anyway. 

My own business idea maybe comes into my head, or not, but now i‚Äôm fine with this. would you choose sales or engineering? This ‚òùüèΩ
I must follow this myself, waste too much time on the phone and Reddit üòìüòì Absolutely will do! Do you mean ROTH, 401 or etf funds? Or a combination of all ? are you into consulting business? Question is not that restrictive. For me definitely sales. Depends on what kind of job security you want. 

Sales can pay much more but pay varies...and job security isn't strong. Economy drops? Bye. 

Engineering? Less pay but still respectable. Plenty of salaried private and gov jobs offering benefits that push your ""total comp"" 20-30k+ higher than just base pay
And job security.

Pick your poison.

I went option two. Security is key imo. Gives peace of mind Employed 401k matching is free $

$100/m from 25 to 65 = 1.3M at retirement.

I started at $600/m at 23.  

Find a financial planner when you hit $50k. Ignore the BS of doing it yourself. Find a bad ass and they will make you wealthy with consistent investments.

Someone also said if you chase $ ‚Ä¶ it was a bad idea.

I agree‚Äîchase your passion and be the best at what you do and you‚Äôll have a lot of money. It will come.

Also, make your money work for you‚Äîthat‚Äôs in the market but real estate too.",2025-01-14 19:07:06

Learn then earn Look at job listings, look by salary. Find stuff that looks interesting after reading the job description, understand that most jobs become mundane with experience, but are extremely hard to get your foot in the door. Go to school or learn a trade if a trade join a union, if school pick that major based on that job search and salary wants. Finish school if you selected that path.

Get a job, start learning and earning. After a few years branch out. My union electrician buddies make way more than I do they will pull like 8K every two weeks with over time.

I'm a senior level tech person and real estate investor. I make 160K a year and own 33 rentals. I used the BRRRR method to acquire the properties, and I went to community college for school got a computer science degree. Worked a help desk for 3 years, swapped to software integration worked that for 5, swapped to DevOps mid career, and now sit as a senior level engineer work from home.

My tenants pay off all of my properties when I retire, I will live off my savings from 401K and the real estate cashflow.

If you want to invest read books, I invest in a boring S&P index fund, and mess around with losing money trading üòÇ. 

The real estate and the full time gig are where it's at. If you have larger aspirations do it, become big time just keep pushing. The thing is people stop pushing and become complacent even if they're uncomfortable because it's familiar. * learn
* don't assume you know
* take risks
* meat & vegetables
* auto-save/auto-invest >10%
* church and don't get cynical because of rotten eggs
* every 6 months evaluate what you want to do in life.
* don't hand you brain off to someone just because they are smart
* set big goals because you're going to have to work hard either way
* walk
* lift weights
* track what you do daily and post it to social media for accountability Loose lips, sink ships. Think before you speak. Turn your gaze inwards and see your life and behaviour very critically. If nothing is changing then you have to change. Be kind to people, be kind to yourself. Always be thrilled to do something. Think good for yourself. Understand others and make yourself understood. Always be soft spoken and use a good vocabulary. Take interest in others, not try to make yourself interesting. Save & invest your money but not at the cost of being able to enjoy (within reason) experiences with your friends and family. Start investing now.  It's never too early or too little money. Don't go straight to University after high school.  
Take some time figuring out what you are really interested in and want to make a career in.  
Don't worry about work/life balance in your 20's, nobody became a leader in their field or created anything exceptional without long hours of extremely hard work. This work needs to be focused and done to advance you/your career to your goal though, don't work yourself to the bone for a crap boss or crap money, do it for yourself. Don't spend money on clothes and shit... Travel and enjoy life instead. Or enjoy a nice meal once in a while. Expensive stuff ain't worth it. Focus. Lock the fuck in.

Apply yourself in school - preferably in something technical or business focused. The doors it will open later in your twenties and thirties - in all facets of your life (money, comfort, love, fulfillment) - are what will separate you from those you now know at school who will never amount to anything and live in their parents basements in perpetuity.

When you get to college - which you need to do to make it - work hard. What you achieve there will determine if it is a waste of time or an opportunity to be successful. For example, if you get As and Bs all through school and get the coveted internship at a Fortune 50 tech company, you‚Äôre a shoe in to get there after graduation. Alternatively, if you lack focus and fuck around, you‚Äôre wasting your time and money - all the opportunities to set yourself apart and get a great job out of school are taken, and/or your grades are too low where nobody takes you seriously.

Imagine making six figures at 25. Buying a home at 30. It‚Äôs possible if you lock the fuck in now. Put the blunt or drink you shouldn‚Äôt have down and go study. Take SAT prep courses and score well. Position yourself well for college admission.

Otherwise‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll find out from fucking around soon enough. Accept and embrace that people are always gonna hate on you to see you succeed, especially the ones closest to you, ironically.   Even the closest friends will secretly be jealous and doesn't want you to see you do well.  You think your friends are different? You shall learn...

But that doesn't mean you need to have resentment.  Be mindful to know that you would probably do this as well and be humble.  Help others when you can but always take care of yourself first bc no one else ever will. Do not marry anyone that doesn't demonstrate through actions an ability to work just as hard as you. 

Say yes to opportunities even if they aren't exactly in line worh your plan. Blow and hookers Be passionate about something and dig in, make mistakes, even stupid ones, and learn. You won‚Äôt succeed but you will gain necessary experiences for your future you. Focus on learning, stay curious, and don‚Äôt be afraid to fail that‚Äôs where the growth happens. All the above, mostly.  But set goals, work hard, reevaluate goals, success, repeat.  

Do not do what the crowd is doing, crowds are dumb, individuals are smart.  

Read, read, read, and listen. Auto save from every paycheck.


Invest in index funds. Compound interest makes millionaires.


Exercise daily, even if it's just a walk or quick HIIT routine.


Read philosophy.


Journal to get your thoughts on paper and clarify your goals.


Learn to cook and make delicious, healthy meals.


Scrutinize your romantic partners heavily before settling down.


Take risks, especially in your 20's.


Avoid religion and cults. They will atrophy your ability to think critically. Spirituality is OK, though.


Savor moments. Learn how to hustle. Meaning both how to put in high effort and gain street smarts.

Develop a specialized skill set that you can sell at a premium.  (Mine is finance and accounting, I‚Äôm pretty decent at it. Find what you‚Äôre good at.)

Make smart decisions.  Save and invest wisely, avoid mistakes that are easily managed‚Ä¶. Like don‚Äôt drink and drive or do blow / heroine for example‚Ä¶

Don‚Äôt let them see you coming.  Don‚Äôt brag on wealth, or drive an overly showy car, rent things like boats or other high dollar low frequency of use items. 

Aquire income producing assets as early as possible and build a portfolio of them. Don‚Äôt just pay attention to successful people and what they do/don‚Äôt do , pay attention to unsuccessful people and ones who don‚Äôt have what you want, and notice what they do and don‚Äôt do. Go to a startup out of college, learn, and make a ton of connections. Then start your own thing. You'll not only have learned from, hopefully, other successful founders - they can support you as you fund raise I haven‚Äôt ‚Äúmade it‚Äù but I feel very fortunate. 

With that being said. Do not drink in excess. Stay away from drugs. You are who you hang out with and you don‚Äôt need the latest and greatest. Take a step back from this culture of consumption that we are surrounded by. 

But mostly, redditor to redditor, don‚Äôt drink in excess. Stay as far out of your comfort zone as possible. On one side you have comfort and the other side you have growth and development. When you are too comfortable, you stop growing and developing. Good luck. Know where you're good at first then start from there. Hookers, Knowledge, and determination are the ways to success 



Also coke. Sick of trying, tired of crying I'm dying inside meüò≠üò≠, please in need of your prayersüôèüôè I'm really tired and need to talk to someone I just feel useless and just can't take it with the kids anymoreüò≠üò≠ Hustle. Obsess. Focus. Avoid distraction. Find out what you‚Äôre good at. Good enough for people to pay you for it. Never give up. That doesn‚Äôt mean chase bad ideas forever. It means  when you get knocked down, you get up. You only lose when you quit. 1. Put on a solid color or white polo shirt, tuck it in. Get a clip board and  go around in housing neighborhoods people who are interested in getting their lawned mowed twice a month. 
2. Say you will starting back up in February. Use ChatGPT to create back business model for lawn care that and include add on‚Äôs if you want. Or you can just keep it simile and say you will mow their lawn. 
3. Get at least 10 people who are willing to sign up and pay in cash or however. You can get cleaver with the payment but must agree to payment. Give a date of when service will start. Then agree to collect on that day before or after service is complete. 
4. Go to your friends or find some kids you know looking to make money and offer them a job. You pay them 40% per each lawn they work on by themselves or 20% if it‚Äôs a two man/woman job. 
5. Every job you contact the people some way round let them know that the person will be arriving and then you and only you collects payment. You pay 40% towards your works, put 20% aside of business, and the remaining 40% goes to you. 
6. Keep up will your clients, expand, then either pass the business on or when you turn 18 create an LLC and go legit 


If the lawn thing doesn‚Äôt work for you in your area try car cleaning, trash pickup, trash pickup or cleaning, window cleaning. Something that someone would need at least twice a month Check and see if your city or government has special money to set aside for student entrepreneurs.  Ex. In Canada they will give you training and then give you up to $3000 to get started if you're young. Don‚Äôt worry, be happy. you've got all the time in the world... until you don't You‚Äôll learn just as much from the ones who didn‚Äôt make it Understand that make it, isnt about the money, Is about being in peace with yourself and your love ones Do work, son. Be bold when the opportunity presents itself. Ask out that girl you‚Äôre interested in. Apply for the high up position. Start your own business when you have an idea you truly believe in. You can‚Äôt move towards your goals without action. Pick a trade or get a high demand degree and work harder than everyone else. You probably need all the advice in the world but one thing i promise you don‚Äôt need is cult churches. If you‚Äôre spiritual practice at home. Think for yourself, question everything, work smart, and be fearless. Keep your eyes on where you want go, make a plan and go for it. When getting up at 4am is a must, you make very different life decisions. Be curious.


Learn for the sake of learning.


It's ok to be vulnerable.


You don't know what you don't know.¬†


Don't be afraid to ask what questions should I ask but didn't.


Enjoy the journey and the rest will come.


Based on your post, I'd say you are on the right track. Keep it up. Always be aware, what's happening around you What do you like kid? Bikes, Pok√©mon, Chess, Shoes? Find a place that has what you like and ask for a sales job. Sell bikes. Sell collectors cards. Sell anything. A good entrepreneur will always need to know how to sell. Selling something you love or are passionate about is the easiest and most enjoyable way to learn how making money works. if you have passion then you can sell. And if you have both then you can make it. Good luck kid. Be smart with what you buy, it goes further than you think! Gather as much information as possible. Look at life like a puzzle that you know you will never solve but still remain dedicated to assembling all the pieces. Most importantly, life is a roller coaster. Learn about @r/FIRE
This would have to be my biggest take away from the past 15 years. 
Look after your health and fitness above all else. 
Love those around you, you don‚Äôt have them forever.
And enjoy the small things! Make lots of mistakes and stand back up. This will teach you resilience and build character and strengths.

Travel and experience life to the fullest. This will open your eyes to other cultures and keep you staying curious and young at heart.

Read. This will give your brains structures, better comprehension and gain ability to understand/communicate complex topics.

And lastly, how you do anything is how you do everything. So learn to do it well. This is going to be unusual but maybe you‚Äôll appreciate something outside the norm. my biggest regret is jumping between domains/industries too much. Always started with zero contacts, insights, and momentum. Pick a lane. Like finance, real estate, pets, children, health, etc. this way even if you fail, your insights, connections and confidence is in a better spot than switching to something else completely. Choose Hard - Fail Fast Say yes to opportunities even if you don‚Äôt know how you will deliver. Let that be up to the person giving you a chance. Make the most out of the experience and use it to continue propelling yourself forward. and for a 28 year old. That ‚Äúmaking it‚Äù changes for you as you go through life. Just make sure that if ‚Äúhaving made it‚Äùcollapses and goes to crap it‚Äôs because you did it to yourself, not the partner you chose. Study hard: read as if you were to live forever. Work hard. Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Savor every single moment. As the great philosopher,Willie Nelson said, ""It's amazing how time slips away."" Write your goals and reread and visualize every morning and evening and imagine the goals achieved. Make them specific.  Feed your mind positive affirmations daily. Read good non fiction books. Take risks and invest regularly in an index fund.  When you can, buy the most life term insurance you can afford. You need to take risks to lead an interesting life. If that sounds good, figure out who in your life has gambled on themselves and won. That is someone you can share your plans with and get valuable feedback from. On the flipside always take advice from people who live more conservatively with a massive grain of salt. They don't necessarily get it and might never warm up to what you're doing until after you've returned with the spoils. Don't go into debt for anything ever, it's all mousetraps. It‚Äôs a marathon not a sprint. Be kind to yourself. Try to live in a way that if you died tomorrow, you could look back at your life you lived and have no regrets. You want to find balance. A couple in their 70‚Äôs told me they wished they had restructured their lives to take advantage of their young bodies when they were young. Travel, rock climb, kayak, hike the PCT. If you work hard your whole life to save up, when you finally have that money you will be very limited with what you can do with it. Every older person I have mentioned this too has agreed. Be disciplined early in life. Read‚Ä¶. A lot. Start a Roth IRA as soon as you can. When you hear good advice take it.

The biggest thing, the first year you start doing good and feel you know your craft? Know that you don't know shit yet. In maybe 6 more years you'll really understand whatever field you're in, but I feel most of us come out after a strong 1st year and think we're geniuses that know better. We can barely walk and have the mindset we're going to win Gold Medals. Keep yourself humble for at least 5 years. Seek God First In All You Do Try lots of different things... except heroin and meth.

Always challenge yourself and never stop learning. If you don't take risks and start something in your early days, you will likely get stuck in life. Don't get me wrong, being stuck is not as bad as it might sound, but you will slowly lose the appetite or capacity to make anything truly big.

I work in tech and make a decent amount of money, but I am tied to my job, if I get laid off it's GGs. I haven't started any side businesses till now, and I'm 30, so I don't have as much risk taking appetite as I would've earlier in life.

If you want to be truly free, you should aim to find a way to divorce your time and how you make money, i.e. it should somehow be passive. Whether this is through real estate, a side business, making one single business and growing it to become huge or selling it to one of the big players and being set for life, those are all just options.

If you go the conventional route of education -> job and put off trying to start something, you will get sucked in and then it's hard to get back out. Discipline is key. Set clear goals, stick to a routine, and work consistently, even when motivation fades. Small daily actions build long-term success Everything is an investment. Even your time. get a job. anything you do will need to be funded. As you work build a skill or skill set that you can sell. By working you can fund your failed attempts at a business until you get it down and become profitable. Like anything else it takes time to be profitable. This is all coming from an 18 yr old with his own businessüôÇ Ikagai Invest invest invest. No shortcut to hard work. You will get what u put in. Stay honest to urself Find a mentor, Work more than everyone. Keep on working on something that you‚Äôre dead set on. If you fail no big deal. Try again. Who you marry actually matters more than you think when it comes to your career ambitions. Learn what the red flags are for narcissistic behavior and don‚Äôt marry a person with them. They will hinder all your entrepreneurial endeavors. Pay yourself first. Save no less than 10% of everything you earn. Get into politics. Try to become a senator. The other advice in here is good also, but with politics ‚Ä¶ Like myself you‚Äôll probably just have to be lucky You don‚Äôt need to make over 200k/yr to be successful financially. Consistent saving will go a long way. I know someone who saved 200k by the time they were 30 with making $60k a year consistently, and saving a lot of it.

The people I‚Äôve seen who are successful financially started young (22-24). They graduated from school with a diploma or bachelors that got them a decent paying job (no, you won‚Äôt make 100k out of school). They stuck with their field (engineering, nursing, teaching, business, etc) and gradually moved up the pay scale. They accumulated savings over 5-10 years, and got a nice nest egg for themselves or a house with equity in it.
To do this you have to know yourself, your aptitudes, and your interests. Also be realistic with yourself - if you‚Äôre struggling in your undergraduate degree maybe don‚Äôt aspire to be a doctor.

Grad school isn‚Äôt the best all end all. It can be helpful in some fields, but not always in others. You also don‚Äôt need that 4.0 gpa (but I would recommend at least a 3).

If you live in a place where the trades are lucrative, that is a way to go to. Constant travel can be hard on a family, though. Looking back I wish I would have started in the trades, or with a 2 year diploma, or a solid undergraduate degree. I made the mistake of thinking I could be a doctor - I tried to get there but didn‚Äôt make it due to a variety of factors. I‚Äôm far worse off than others I know who simply started working relatively young. ‚ÄúMake something people want‚Äù - YC Combinator. Listen to people‚Äôs and businesses‚Äô frustrations. Find a niche market and solve the pain. Simple yet not easy to do. Quit alcohol Surround yourself with people doing better than you Focus on building skills, not just making money right now. Read, learn, and work hard at something that interests you. Get a job if you can any job. Use it to develop discipline and save a bit. Most importantly, don‚Äôt waste your time; your effort today compounds over time Having time to learn is a privilege‚Äîmake the most of it.

As I‚Äôve gotten older, I‚Äôve come to realize a few things:

1. I genuinely enjoy learning.
2. I‚Äôm capable of mastering things I once thought were too difficult.
3. When I was younger, I didn‚Äôt fully appreciate the incredible privilege of having time to dedicate solely to learning‚Äîlike during college.

As life goes on and responsibilities grow‚Äîwork, family, kids‚Äîthat time becomes more scarce. So, my simple advice is this: find what you love and immerse yourself in learning everything you can about it. Take advantage of the time you have now, because it won‚Äôt always be so abundant. Just do what you love, you'll figure it out along the way. Be careful of all vices and be very aware of the people that surround you and the direction they travel. Many times the people we trust might be incompetent in their lives and lead with no direction, don‚Äôt be the blind following the blind. Success escapes many because they have no direction, lack focus, spend beyond their means, and fail to take action when opportunities arise, there will be many. Don‚Äôt be the guy that thinks, ‚Äúif I had $15k right now that would be a perfect opportunity. Be the guy that has planned and set goals to save that $15k and constantly searches to grow their wealth.‚Äù Also, try not to make enemy of friends. It‚Äôs better to build a network for the long run than take the short gain. Those goofy friends might be wealthy or gain position of power, trust and loyalty go a long way. You probably know all of this, many do yet so many have to live these truths to learn from the experience. By then much is lost. Ive not made it. I make good 6 figures but am struggling. I won‚Äôt give you advice on what has worked for me. I will give you advice I wish I had been given. 

Good debt does exist, but it is much more rare than we like to think.  As much as possible, stay debt free and don‚Äôt end up in the traps i got myself into. Honestly so many average people never take initiative to actually learn anything or attack it with vigor. I know people who‚Äôve been telling me what they‚Äôre gonna do for the last 10 years and have never done it. Go at things hard and be an absolute sponge. Try to soak up every useful bit of information you can. But when I say that I don‚Äôt mean watch fake gurus and rich influencers online, I mean actually read and talk to legitimately successful people and ask questions. But just get ACTUALLY good at whatever if it you want to do. If you are one of the best at almost anything, you will be successful. And yes, launching businesses and scaling them is a skill too. But you can be the best at any individual profession and in most cases be pretty successful. Read the Book of Five Rings by Miyamoto Musashi or listen to Jocko Willink and Tim Ferris‚Äôs podcast about it.


A few key principles he emphasized:

1. The Way is in training - Musashi stressed that true mastery comes through constant practice and dedication. He believed there were no shortcuts, only persistent refinement of skills.

2. Know many ways but master one - While he advocated understanding many disciplines (‚Äúlearning the ways of all professions‚Äù), he emphasized deeply mastering your chosen path.

3. Observe thoroughly - Musashi emphasized careful observation of both yourself and others. He believed mastery required understanding principles deeply enough to see them manifested everywhere.

4. Eliminate the unnecessary - A key principle was that mastery involves identifying and removing what is not essential. As he wrote: ‚ÄúThe primary thing when you take a sword in your hands is your intention to cut the enemy, whatever the means.‚Äù Don‚Äôt be in a hurry to start a business if you are not 100% sure and have all the resources and research ready. Otherwise first learn make few mistakes and then get better clarity for what you really want. It‚Äôs okay to do it slowly and steadily. Don‚Äôt fall into this quick money crap and retiring at 30 crap.¬† Find something you are good at that you enjoy that there is a big demand for. Leverage people technology and land to create wealth. Improve yourself. Get a good education and grind skills as much as you can, get a good 9 to 5, and invest into the S&P 500.

You've then got money and skills to decide whether you want to start up a business or not. Usually spending weekends or time after work to build on a business until ready to quit the 9 to 5. No one has ""made""  it, everyone is striving for something else. My advice is to focus on creating the life you want and try to enjoy the ride.

Don‚Äôt wait. do a small bussiness for start just for discorver max a roth ira with a regular job before starting a business. get your bases covered before you start making risky plays (business). people do bad things when they are desperate so make sure you keep yourself ever from needing to be desperate Grow up.. Invest Most ""business owners making $1milion on instagram"" actually don't make money. 

Live with your parents for as long as reasonably possible. 

Don't be blinded by what peers are doing, don't go for expensive cars, houses, clothes, new phones. Nobody got rich by spending every dime they made. These days it isn't even about getting rich, but affording rent and groceries. Save up. 

You have the beautiful resource of the internet. Go find out what you like, what your strengths and weaknesses are, what you want to do in life. Explore your interests. Speak to people in those fields, maybe ask to shadow someone on a day at work, get to know everything you need to make an educated choice. 

And then, don't go into (huge) debt. Go to an affordable college near family (where you'll live to save on expenses.) Here's a guide to a quick start up for a business: https://clayplug.com/bot-for-irl-job-skills-and-fun-not-money-but-heres-how/

My main advice is this: those with the courage and authenticity to get something big need the humility and self-management to keep it (cf. Dr. Tim Irwin's book ""Derailed"")

Godspeed young one. The world is your oyster I‚Äôd start by getting some experience, and some money, by getting a job in a field that interests you I haven't actually ""made"" it.  

But I sure have failed **A LOT.**

The primary reason was never what most people would tell you.  It was because I gave up.

1. **Don't give up.**    
  
All other things follow from this, the main reason people fail is they give up (or they die).  All the other reasons really are just excuses. i.e. Running out of money isn't a reason, its an excuse.  Raise more money etc.  Borrow money etc.  
  
Here are some tips for not giving up:  
  
1. a)  Make sure you like your customer.  Its really hard to keep helping someone when you hate their guts.   


1. b)  Always have ample cash for a rainy day.  At least 2 years of expenses.  
  
1. c)  Make sure you feel like what your doing is actually good for people. 

Right before you are about the quit, seems like the edge where big changes happen.   
Don't let your self quit.  Physcially move your bed closer to your work place. To add to the great inputs already submitted. 

1. Enter every conversation from a position of grace. Most people are not out to get you

2. Capitalize on opportunities presented to you (you never know when something awesome may pop up)

3. Put yourself in a position to meet the person who can change your life (be it an investor, mentor, etc)

4. Should be higher on my list, but marry the right person when the time comes. This was the single biggest factor for me

5. Niche equals rich. It‚Äôs cliche but it‚Äôs true

6. Don‚Äôt buy/own a bar Wait another 17 years to start worrying Invest in yourself, focus on learning, building discipline, and staying curious. Those habits will pay off in every area of your life. Stop listening to the people saying learn then earn. The goal is to think of a way you can make money, experiment, then you might make some money or you might not. Always experiment. Try to make money. Stop procrastinating unless you‚Äôre going to be 50 years old and when your mates are retiring you‚Äôre starting a business get rid of friends who aint about making money Marry into wealth.  Time is on your side. You may want to read about Baumol‚Äôs cost disease. It shouldn‚Äôt be your sole guiding light, but when looking at the profits you expect from your career it‚Äôs worth knowing. Finish your studies. Self respect and never entertain the thought of impressing others Consider what you're really good at and what gets you in that ""flow state"" - that could be art, coding, accounting, creating, playing an instrument, whatever. Think about how you can create unique value doing that and if you enjoy the tradeoff of doing it for your livelihood. I wish I had considered this sooner. Remove ‚Äúwork life balance‚Äù and ‚Äúretirement‚Äù from your vocabulary.  Successful people love what they do and don‚Äôt yearn for either. You're alive. You made it Work for yourself. The best employer ever. 
Find something you love doing and figure out a way to make a living doing it. Surround yourself with the right people. Ones that align with your goals and morals. That match your drive. People with success and wisdom that you would like to have yourself. It's interesting how many people mention learning as the key not just for  business but for life in general seems like that's a foundation regardless of the specific path you take Always do your research but take action/ leap of faith. Get started and try to fail small and learn big. I am an engineer who also dabbles in real estate. I have been told I‚Äôm lucky all the time but luck is just being prepared with the know how when the opportunity is presented. 

Next thing I can recommend is networking with everyone. People possessed skillets and interests that you might not which can be valuable to you in the future. Even connecting others can be helpful and humbling at the same time. Being the fulcrum is a pivotal part of success. Understand that the battle is slow and uphill. Anything that is too good to be true probably is too good to be true. Invest $25 a month in bitcoin! Buy stocks with extra income. Set an affordable budget for investing while you‚Äôre young and don‚Äôt have a ton of expenses. Stick to it, stocks will grow, take that money and buy real estate or start a business. Be learning new skills now and always Connections are important, so don't be overly proud of being an introvert if you are it‚Äôs Stupid. be extrovert and build connection as much as you can from people of different fields and interest. You‚Äôll learn a lot, believe me. I wasted 10 years of my life sitting in front of a computer doing programming and achieved nothing. Today, I have friends who are younger than me and know so much about the world, jobs, organizational life, and have the confidence to thrive in these areas. Two of them even own their own businesses and drive expensive cars, and both are five years younger than me. Stay away from drinking and drugs. I've had the best times and stories, but the lows were rock bottom. 

All that time & money spent chasing a good time was wasted because I could've spent it building myself God First. Seek God first Get through school and find someone you love, that also works full time. Not old and haven't made it but am doing more than well for my age. My advice is to make the most of every moment. Try to spend as little time doing things like scrolling through social media. A lot of people in life are biologically alive but have been dead for years because they've stagnated and exist just to exist. Living to make the most of every moment can also mean you spend a lot of time being productive if you can stay disciplined and focusedüëç Pick a hobby and stick with it. By the time you‚Äôre 25 you‚Äôll be proficient enough to charge for it.

e.g. musical instrument, hacking, fitness (trainer). Most people overestimate what they can do in a year, but underestimate what they can do in 10. Every 17 year old would be immensely better if they gave up social media, mass media, and drugs and focused on grades, skills and quality friendships with quality people.  

Those 3 things will predict your success to a large degree.  There is no magic bullet, we all know we should be doing these 3 things, but here we are, writing dumb comments to each other on reddit, making reddit owners wealthier as life slowly passes us by. Enjoy life (friends, hobbies, interests, learning, traveling, etc.). 

Worry about starting a business once you‚Äôre financially stable and have expertise in an industry. 

My advice is wait until you have 250k+ net worth, a house in order, 10+ years of experience, management experience, and a stable family. 

Otherwise your odds of failure are high and not worth the opportunity cost of retirement contributions (20x + future time value of money since you have ~ 45 years of compound interest to look forward to). Learn sales and learn to code (AI helps a LOT nowadays)

Hope it helps dude! Always be learning and growing
Don't gossip
Surround yourself with good people
Beware of vices/addictions
Control your ego
Learn to say NO
Save for retirement ASAP (so you can retire ASAP, if you want)
Be a giver Businesses are, by definition, someone paying you to do something very difficult (mentally or phyiscally), very unpleasant (also mentally or physically) or very expensive, or any combination of those three things. If what people needed were easy, fun and cheap, there'd be no business. Therefore, figure out what very difficult, very unpleasant or very expensive thing you can do and excel at and you will always be successful. Look for a mentor put as much spare cash as you can into a Roth IRA.  facts! Fear is the poison. Hustle is the antidote For me as a 16 yo I build games and consumer apps. All you need is time, a lot of dedication and of course passion. Learn sales. You can take that with you forever. I‚Äôve found having to make up for lost time is helpful. Living a life where you fall behind usually means you‚Äôre doing interesting or fun things. Followed by the hustle and passion of catching up can slingshot one further than if they‚Äôre steadily but moderately on track the whole way. Soft skills run the world.. Negotiation, sales (everything is a sale) and authentic connection with other humans. 

Read Never split the difference by Criss Voss (then watch the masterclass) also Jordan Belforts straight line persuasion.. Behavioral psychology is the key to understanding how we all operate (thinking fast and slow etc).  

These things are on piratebay or other resources.. The sections on mirroring and repetition, 'start from no' the psychological tricks to get people to talk too much, overshare, and side step the cognitive mental barriers to agreeing to things, fascinating and especially Chris Voss's work, are mind blowingly effective. 

These things can be learned in a couple of weeks and INSTANTLY start paying off (dates, work, business etc). 

In the coming AI world they will still be huge assets. Trust me, these simple techniques have made me millions. Start by investing in yourself. Learn skills that interest you and can make you valuable‚Äîcoding, writing, sales, whatever clicks with you. You don‚Äôt need money to start hustling, just time and consistency.

Also, build connections. Talk to people who inspire you, ask questions, and learn from their journey. At 17, your biggest advantage is time‚Äîuse it to explore, fail, and grow.

You got this! Keep your ears open and your mouth shut.

Be honest.

If you wait for things to happen they never will.

You'll be surprised at people who should support you that will get jealous at your success.

Embrace imposter syndrome. It will prevent complacency.

Be nice to everybody on the way up because you'll meet the same people on the way down.

Always respect your elders but never assume someone is smarter than you just because they're older.

Don't let someone else's behavior dictate your personal standards. Make it something you love to do. What I start doing young is reading and learning about entrepreneurship, investing, marketing etc and when you decide what you love to do as a business you already know how to grow your business, my problem then was that I was earning more than I was expecting‚Ä¶ Im 19 myself and I am still figuring out my path. What I learned in my first year in college is that people surrounding you is important. Don‚Äôt be afraid to connect with people, anyone you talk to can make you learn something new. Still, filter out friends that hold you back in life (they can come in many forms). 

Find people that you can consider your lifetime mentors. They could be your father, uncle, friend. I look up to my brother and a family friend and closely take inspiration from their life. Target to view things or issues or realities as clearly as possible. Refkect before you make any decision. Build that high awareness/emotional intelligence as much you can. You'll have a stress-free life. ü§îwork hard,work smart First figure out what your definition of made it is. What is your definition of success? Someone could be a high school teacher working at a school for Autistic high school students (my son) and he thinks he made it. Or you can be on wall street living in a great coop on the upper east side and feel like a failure and be miserable (his friend from high school) G Take advice from people that are in a position you want to be in eventually, but also temper it with by looking at the quiet or hidden hand outs and hand ups they were given to get there.


Eg folks that want to get in shape take advice from folks in shape. They don't take advice from someone fat. People want to take advice from someone that looks like they practice what they preach. But, a lot of fitness influencers are on peds that give them a hidden advantage. I learned that when i got into bodybuilding. Reading magazines where lifters were like ""my secret is eating rice and apple sauce post training"". Bs. Your secret is steroids.


Same in business. Most folks won't tell you their secret sauce for success, bc they don't want competitors. But if a successful person likes you and starts spilling the beans, listen to them. But remember they may have had a headstart with money from parents or paid in full college or whatever.


But, what helped me the most when younger was being presentable. Look good, smell good, sound good. Do 2 of those things at all times, and do all 3 when trying to impress.


Look good by dressing well and dressing for your target (eg suit for business, casual for hanging out, etc).


Smell good is easy, too, but people,neglect it at times. Shower. Rinse, suds, rinse. Use antiperspirant not just deodorant. Brush your teeth. Wear a nice cologne. Not that ""sport scent"" shit, but a nice cologne like givenchy brand that has more complexity to it and lasts longer.


Sound good. Speak well. Don't sound ghetto or hick. Learn better words and try to sound like you have a brain. Don't overuse large words, but using a large word every now and then lets folks know you have a brain. Speak steady and succinctly (there's a big word). If you want to be in charge, john waynes advice or speakijg low, slow and don't say much might help. Most folks like folks that are calm and colected as leaders.


Now, you can't always control how you dress or smell. But you can always control how you speak and sound. And it's uaually pretty easy to control looking or smelling good.


Controlling smell is more important than clothes, though.



Think of it this way...if you met a person in a suit that spoke well but had BO...not a good impression. But if you met someone in a tank top and shorts, but they smelled like cologne and spoke well...this person must be succesful and just casual today.


Looking good, smelling good and sounding good will open doors for you., people will prefer to hire or do business with you vs a slob or bo person or someone that sounds like an idiot or hick or gangster. If you choose to work for someone else as an employee, pick the job that offers the biggest learning opportunities and move companies frequently to experience different cultures and leadership / management styles. This is worth WAY more than a big salary. I got this wrong and I wasted a decade. You‚Äôll rise soon enough. Good luck x Put yourself out there more, you never know what kind of opportunities an acquaintance can hook you up with. On that note, while you shouldn‚Äôt care what people think about you, perception does matter. Have confidence in yourself. Anything is possible with a long enough time horizon and enough effort. You can do anything, but you can‚Äôt do everything. Learn direct-response marketing (plenty to learn on YouTube for free, or buy a couple Dan Kennedy books for $10 each).  Start now.  Get obsessed.  Don't stop.  By the time you're 30, you will be making a ton of money, have helped a ton of people achieve their financial goals, and freed yourself up to live a higher purpose because you're not spending all your bandwidth worrying about money or trying to make ends meet.

30 sounds like a long way from now, but it'll be here faster than you know.  And what you do now is creating the life you will have in the future.

Good luck! You‚Äôve never ‚Äúmade it‚Äù as your always working to get somewhere or working to stay there. Stop sometimes and enjoy where you are and what you‚Äôre doing. Goals are good. Work towards them. Realize you have this one life. Don‚Äôt waste it doing shit you don‚Äôt enjoy (work, relationships, hobbies, living accommodation, etc) For longterm success, you‚Äôre selling people Trust. Get a job, learn an industry and some skills, understand the industry, travel, build a network, travel more, understand the real pain points the industry has then - and only then - consider whether you want to spend the next 10-15 years of your life running a business. Start a business selling water to small african children Try to figure out how you can turn learning skills into a game. Start with marketing, then negotiating. 

You have a really big head start on most people, as someone else here said, the average business owner starts at 40. You have a really bright future OP. Start to invest money in the broad stock market. Start on monday, invest every month, never stop investing anymore. 

Try to maximise your income while minimizing your spendings. Be very critical about any recurring costs. 

Consider to seperate your bank accounts in two categories: One where you receive and spend money from (your daily-use bank account) and another which is allowed to only receive and invest but never spend (or send back) any money - this is your 'lock in forever'-money.

Send money from your daily account to the other one as often as possible and invest it from there in buy-and-hold assets.

By 40 or 50 you should be a millionaire. It worked fine for me. Why shouldn't it for you? Good luck on your journey! Learn about investing as soon as you can. Get an education. Learn to learn, surround yourself with smart people - remember you are the average of the people you surround yourself with. Starting a company is solving someone else‚Äôs problems, that they are willing to pay for. And, remember to have fun‚Ä¶. Life is long. Play it sustainably. Always live below your means Network 

Learn on someone else‚Äôs dime

Learn a bit of coding to automate the boring/tedious stuff Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. Don‚Äôt party your 20s away Dont drink or smoke weed. Its unlikely youll get addicted and kill someone driving around like a maniac like anti-drug education tries to scare you with.¬†

The real pain is that you might get a persistent habit that wastes an incredible amount of time and leaves you scrambling to catch up later in life.¬† I've started several companies. I've made a decent amount of money. Enough not to worry about it. I've made many mistakes along the way.

Here are the things I'd suggest to anyone - learn who you are, and who you want to be. You could spend decades chasing other peoples ideas of success, living other people's idea of a good life, and trying to earn the respect of people that live totally differently to your own goals.  
  
Examine your values. Really understand what you want. This will, of course, change as you get older. But the more you get used to working from your values outward, and acting to contribute to the world from your strengths, the more you will find success and the happier you will be.  

Success will not look like what you imagine now, and you will not achieve it the way you think. Having integrity, resiliency, and adaptability will get you there.

Start by writing down the person you want to be write now, and the characteristics of that person. Maybe you want to be a great friend: what are the actions, practices, and values of a great friend? Then work every day to do those things. 

Achievement will come. But doing this will give you something better - purpose. I‚Äôm a 19 year old business owner in the financial industry with a team of over 300 people. With the course I‚Äôm on I will be making over 200k by June 2025. My biggest piece I can offer you is to take every opportunity given to you, we‚Äôre young you never know until you try. Empty your cup, we don‚Äôt know what we don‚Äôt know stay coachable. OP, literally the average business owner starts at 40.

ignore the media idealizing young rich people and the social media narratives.

you have time. the good thing is your speaking up about it and trying to make a change.

just put as much time into learning as possible. follow your interests, heavily.

i decided i would give myself a learning budget basically allowing myself to spend as much as i want to learn whether it be on amazon books,¬†[trends.co](https://trends.co/)¬†($300/year)¬†or¬†[theadvault.co.uk](https://theadvault.co.uk/)¬†(free) or whatever. i needed to move forward, whatever that meant.

don‚Äôt learn about things you‚Äôre supposed to, learn about things that energize you.

for example, my first job out of college after i ran out of money as a music producer (i had a dry spell and pivoted) was working in music. while i was in that industry i started getting paid $35k/year in los angeles. not enough to live.

so i started experimenting with online businesses and after some trial and error had a couple wins on the side then got caught by my company and they didn‚Äôt like me building online businesses. so i went back to work and hid my projects tbh but kept doing it cause i loved it. then when i got good enough at coding i left the industry for a job that i liked more and paid me 2x and let me build side businesses.

so yea just follow your interests and stay focused.

i‚Äôve had multiple times i‚Äôve felt lost, just push through it and use it to fuel you. Good advice I do this already at 15, but this alone doesn't help. Any other ideas? Can you please expain the ""respond don't react"" part further? I don't get it. What do you mean by rinse? Thank you for this.....seems a life hack This is the way. Yup. Average age of business owners is 40 for a reason. Then you return. This is a good one but I tried to earn first and learned through mistakes. Everyone has a different path.. What books would you recommend? kindly How did you get into real estate? I always thought it‚Äôs one of the hardest to get into.

Also, like the other guy said, do you recommend any books? To add on:

Spend on self development. Invest in yourself. You have to live with the choices you make. Buy books, seminars, professional time, travel, try new things. Invest in you and you will have many people to tell many stories to. Grow your garden, attract the butterflies. I would say listen to smart people who have been around the block a few times. I deeply regret not listening to people who had much more experience than I did. I was young and way too confident in myself Think before you speak, that's good advice. I had a growing YouTube channel, then I told a friend about it. He teased me about it, it spread, then I got insecure, and I deleted the whole thing. I threw away months of hard work and dedication all because of my loose lips! I‚Äôm hoping for that, but where I live, they make it extremely hard to do anything financial (banks, investments etc.) before 18, or at least I need my parents consent, which is also hard. This thing is somewhat overwhelming me‚Ä¶.

I always wanted take a gap year before uni, but I‚Äôm scared that I end up just behind all, not sure if I‚Äôll gain something or if I‚Äôll just graduate later than my friends with nothing worth the extra yearü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Second this, I‚Äôm in no position to give advice and I‚Äôve lived a great life so far but I wish I hadn‚Äôt fucked off so much in my teen years. TBH I still don‚Äôt know what should I lock in with? 

I‚Äôm not a SAT (or anything similar) student, I‚Äôm in my local school system, which is stupid, to say the least. I have hundreds of pages of crap to memorize this year. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Imm trying to get great grades in school, but I wanna focus on myself in my free time, but don‚Äôt know where to start. That second part is so important. I can think of numerous occasions in my early twenties that I rejected opportunities just because it didn‚Äôt align with my path as an accountant. I eventually dropped out of school but missed on chances to be an apprentice lock smith, bar tender, and land surveyor for construction company. Any of which would have been a great choice for me in my early twenties. I'm wondering if this is perhaps the way, AFTER you make something of yourself? But hell what do I know? I'm just some guy! haha I think people underestimate how important it is to be careful who you settle down with. My first real boyfriend was so supportive, he often helped me with my business when I needed an extra pair of hands, we always bounced ideas off each other and when i came home from work crying every day, he encouraged me to quit and start my a business.We broke up because we were young 20's with too much pressure. My next boyfriend was manipulative, controlling, and abusive. I'm still trying to pick myself back up from that 2 years later. I'm living at home with my parents again,  I lost my passion for most things that I loved, and I'm starting all over again with starting a business. Of course, covid didn't help either. 

So picking the right partner is so important Lots of coke‚Ä¶ start at lunchtime just to be safe. By the way, starting your own business isn't the end all be all. It's expensive. Just work for someone. Life Hack: Get yourself in a NO equity startup acceleration program. That usually unlocks a shit Tom of free credit so that you don‚Äôt spend a Dime on infrastructure for at least 12 months. Also, do everything you fucking can to get into an ivy league school, graduation diploma is worthless but the connections, experiences and talking to you teachers alone make it absolutely it. Ohh and also.. Prioritize health.. I spent a long time not doing so, and am pretty lucky to be in half decent shape despite spending a lot of my life not in healthy lifestyle mindsets. 

Its much easier at 17 to stay healthy than it is each year that passes to get back to healthy. Also, for the look good part... I was broke af when young, but shopped at thrift stores for dress shirts, dress slacks and suits. Shoes i would pop good money for good leather dress shoes, though. Pair of brown, pair of black.¬†


I'd go to goodwill, could get dress shirts for $4/ea. I'd find the goodwill near the good neighborhood that all the well off folks donated their stuff to. I'd spend hours sifting through cig burn, ink stains, etc to find the nice dress shirts... Van Heusen, Roundtree abd York,,etc.


Try them on. Make sure no stains, etc. For a couple of hours od shifting i could find 10 dress shirts...$40 of shirts. These things lasted YEARS. Good quality stuff.


Same w dress slacks.


For suits, i think goodwill separates jackets from slacks these days, but back in the day they had full suits on a single rack. I'd try them on. As long as the fit was ok, and it was a nice suit (not wrinkly, fabric was thich and nice) i was able to buy a suit for $20 then take it to an tailor for $50 to get it tailored to me. A very nice $500 suit for less than $100.


This was 20 yrs ago (now i feel old), so prices have prob gone up.


But i was working $4-7/hr jobs but could dress like i was a young professional. That stuff got my foot into so many doors. I spoke well, wore cologne (i still use givency Pi and givenchy Xyreus Rouge to this day) and dressed well.


This let me jump from blue collar manual labor jobs to office jobs, got into data/tech, then eventually went to college for degrees,to further my career. After working fast food and other shite jobs as a teen i swore I'd never work shite like that again..i wasn't ""too good"" for it, but i had more self respect for myself that i never wanted to work jobs where i wasn't respected or had to work shit/odd hours, or come home smelling like crap. Worked dock shipping jobs..long hours,,sore back. Can't do that forever. Much happier coding databases, and doing business analysis for fortune 500 company these days. Not to mention my business has minimal start up costs!! I realize that most young rich people on social media are faking it, or at least they are the minority we only see because people ‚Äûlike it.‚Äú

But for me, life is too short to delay the ‚Äúfun‚Äù till I‚Äôm old. But my silly self keeps procrastinating everything ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Think independently so you can describe things with your own words. It's gonna help the older you get. Don't get me wrong, its awesome that you already do this at 15, but at this age you aren't (presumably) that often in company of people who you could hear interesting things from.

Damn when I was 15 I did it too but 99% of things I heard was typical teenage banter and school stuff, ain't noone talking business to a 15yo. But yes, occasionaly you might hear some important things as well, that isn't excluded, good job mate. I would‚Äôve worded that last part differently, I would‚Äôve phrased it as ‚Äúthere is a lot out of our control in this world but we always have the choice of how we react.‚Äù Life will throw curveballs at you, ultimately the only thing you can control is how you react to those curveballs. People that react are prone to having their buttons pushed and jekred around by folks that learn how they react. Reaction is just instinctual flying off the handle by hot heads or cowering ir nervous lauging by doormats. Thinking things through before responding, and then choosing an appropriate response provides more control and measure. Sometimes someone pissing you off isn't being malicious and just needs a gentle reminder to straighten up. Other times someone is purposefully jerking you around and its better to smile and walk away to spend time plotting a revenge so sweet they ll be drowning in sugar when you're done with them. Emotional reaction vs thought out response Rinse and repeat is a colloquialism meaning to do something repetitively. Improve as needed (like rinse your hands) and repeat the process - a common phrase esp in Entrepreneurship and in general in life üòÅ Like washing a plate before you put in the dishwasher I mean, you can always speed up the process... The book on rental property investing by Brandon Turner. I've read a lot of books on the subject that's the one that got me started. Bigger Pockets is a shell of what it used to be and Brandon has left but that book should get you started Good add. Agree. This is my point‚Ä¶

Listen to smart people.¬†

But make your own decisions.¬†

Smart people aren‚Äôt smart about everything.¬† It sounds like it was more due to your insecurity in that case Behind what or who?  
In the end the race is long and its only with yourself.  
Taking a year to figure out who you are and what you really care about & are interested in outside of a school environment will put you ahead of people your age.  
Especially if Uni is a big financial commitment where you are.  
Also, you can learn/build whatever you want in that year on your own. Where would you suggest me starting? I 

You‚Äôve said that you‚Äôre not in a position to give advice but I think you kinda are since you now know where you screwed up. Most successful people I know do what I said above - they start strong in high school, go to a solid university and finish in 4 years, then get their first 8 or so years of experience. At that point, once they have a good rhythm at work and are comfortable, they might start a small business on the side.

You do not and should not worry about ‚Äústarting a business‚Äù at your age. You know jack shit about running one, which is where you will eventually derive value from several college courses that will prepare you for that. Focus on what‚Äôs important in your world now, which is your education. 

If you still want to work, I‚Äôd strongly recommend learning how to build websites. Even if it‚Äôs simple shit in Squarespace or Wix, this is a skill you‚Äôd need later once you wanna start your own business. This is a skill you can build in your free time while also charging others a decent amount once you understand best practices for building small business websites. Also jerk off twice a day. Once in the morning, right after you work out, then once right after lunch. You gotta feed the geese to keep the blood flowing. Gotta keep the rhythm below the belt Lol learn from the mistakes of others (aka these guys) This is sadly true. It‚Äôs a lot of passive constant work to see through the BS going on social media. You can work hard and enjoy yourself. Making enough money to live the fake influencer lifestyle is not realistic or what's actually happening to them. 

Read the book Mastert by Roberte Greene May I ask, where have you got the idea that starting a business is fun? Is this from social media or something? Or it's just the money? Given that a reaction is an instinctive and emotional response to a situation, and a response is a thoughtful and deliberate action. The reaction could potentially be a snap decision without any thought or consideration to the situation. The response, is thought out and taking consideration of all aspects of a situation in order to make a decision or rebuttal. Of course. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs an average. Will see where can I find it, thank you! Well, given that I know nothing about you OP, I don‚Äôt know exactly what advice to give you and everyone‚Äôs different. But I think a really good starting point would be to read these books - How to Win Friends and Influence People, Seduction, 48 Laws of Power, Psychology of Money, Rich Dad Poor Dad. If you have no money you can go to the library Understood, really appreciate it! Those are rookie numbers I meant the fun of being financially stable not the process of running the business. Thank you!",2025-01-14 19:02:30
Entrepreneur,what makes your business more valuable to a future buyer.,"r - you've got to be strategic about this. It's not just about running the business; it's about building it with the end in mind. Keep good books, focus on EBITDA growth, and always be thinking about what makes your business more valuable to a future buyer.  
  
How's that for some food for thought? Have you considered how you might structure your own exit strategy?  
  I used bizzed ai xyz Net I don‚Äôt know Kenya but its southern neighbour Tanzania suff","good, growth, valuable",,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i1ics7/anyone_own_liquor_stores_or_gas_stations/,Anyone own liquor stores or gas stations? ,"We have an acquaintance in our friend group who him self owns liquor stores and gas stations.  He's kind of  annoying because he's constantly telling us that he's his own boss and he could never work for a company.  That being said - most of us just work corporate jobs and for the most part, we enjoy it. This guys works a lot (weekends, holidays) and his constantly complaining about terrible employees.  He complains a lot but he says the money is worth it - which got us to thinking - how much can an owner make at a normal sized liquor store in a average American small city (population less than 100k)



","I spent 20 years in this business. You can easily make 200k annually in a decent store. [removed] I don't know if the principle is the same for Kenya and the USA but I have tried starting the business in Kenya and so far so good , the liquor store I opened has been growing in leaps and bounds despite the corrupt cops who collect bribes on the daily and the bad economy we are experiencing What kind of lifestyle does he have? A town of 100k people could easily have 30+ gas station/liquor stores. I'm guessing the profitability would depend on whether there are 20 stations or 50. And most adults consume either or both (gas and alcohol) at a high rate. I sell to a lot of gas stations & liquor stores. Results vary a lot. I do have stores as customers which I know are making $50k, $100k, even $250k per MONTH in net profit.

Some gas stations in ATL making $200k+ per month on gasoline alone.

Some busy small town liquor stores doing $100k+/mo.

Then of course there are plenty of stores barely getting by. And everything in between.

Particularly with gas stations it‚Äôs really the property owner making the big bucks. My friend owns the corner store in my neighborhood of San Francisco, and he still has to commute out of the city to work a full time job in order to actually support his family.  
  
It's certainly not a gold mine, and when he's not at his day job, he is working at the corner store.

He bought the store from his brother, who also worked as a city bus driver until he retired in order to supplement the meager liquor store income. My grandfather owned a gas station and still owns a liquor store in a rural town in southeast Ky. Both of which were/are a money pit and time sink. No money in them unless you operate and manage them yourself.

Couldn‚Äôt find employees for the gas station and nobody drinks anymore around here, everybody does pills and meth pretty much.

Sad facts. I‚Äôm looking at a liquor store and building purchase right now. Very busy and profitable‚Ä¶ million a year in gross and the owner after everything including building expenses is netting 350k. Seems worth it to me. Get few employees you can trust for the needed time off and make that cheddar! ‚úåüèª I don't own either, but I do own a company that supplies over 60+ gas stations and liquor stores with inventory so perhaps I can chime in after my decade of experience with dealing with this demographic. 

If you buy a gas station, the first thing to do is check the age of the underground storage tanks. Somewhere along the lines, the EPA came out with these new guidelines that those tanks be replaced every 20 years and quite a few states adopted laws regarding this. I'm not sure if it's true everywhere, but when they started doing that in the 90s it bankrupted a lot of smaller operators. A lot of guys will try to pull a fast one and sell their stores before the recommended replacement time comes up. One of my guys got screwed this way and he was too naive to realize it, and had to pay over $200,000 for the job not long after he closed on the store. The weights and measures department from the city came knocking on the door and said these tanks are old and need to be replaced or else. 

The good part is a lot of gas stations are located on prime corners or busy streets (location, location, location) and sales can be consistent regardless of gas brand or ownership. But be warned, if you have bad employees you will lose sales. I've seen super busy stores go down in volume because of consistently bad service... a solid customer base can take years to gain and only seconds to lose. The actual owner of the store doesn't care because he has about 5 others in his portfolio, and his other stores are starting to take a huge decline as well because he refuses to change the overhead lights on the canopy over the pumps and doesn't keep the store clean. 

Your fuel sales pay the bills. All your inside sales (snacks, drinks, etc) are what's really profitable. Potato chips are usually 30% gross margin, 20oz soda is around 35%. The lowest margins are in tobacco and alcohol but those are usually the highest volume items. The highest margins are in non-food items such as vapes, beanie babies (there's quite a few stores that have them), those knock off t shirts and caps, basically anything that isn't consumable. These are more common in stores that service lower income communities. 

Another key to success is putting the right product in front of the right customers. If you're in a higher income area, stocking your store with endless varieties of vapes, CBD, smokes, and similar accessories isn't going to bring you many sales simply due to differing tastes. Thats another thing I've learned too- the nicer the neiguborhood, the less busy the store. Why? Middle class people and above typically spend the fewest dollars at gas stations because they buy most of their food at grocery stores and don't want to pay extra for snacks. There are exceptions to this, such as Stores located off busy interstates, but the concept of a neighborhood convenience store just isn't as successful as it it is in lower income urban or scarce rural areas. Stores in lower income areas are usually very busy because most of the customer base are recipients of food stamps and they'll spend countless dollars on chips, snack cakes, sodas, etc. A lot of people don't like that, but it's a huge deal if you own a store. 

All my customers have family members work for them to save on labor costs. I have no idea how they're compensated, but there's few jobs a newly indian immigrant can work if he doesn't speak English well and doesnt understand the culture so his uncles gas station offers he\she opportunity to work. This helps tremendously with employee turnover and staffing shortages, but this probably wouldn't apply to you unless you have a million cousins lol. They don't celebrate Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc so they're always working without issue. lol dont ask. go there and see if there is a separate register for the cash. I recently met a guy who started with gas stations, ventured into liquor stores and eventually parlayed that into tequila/agave spirit imports, distribution, and brand. 

No idea how much he makes, but kinda sheds light on the potential. My dad made quite a bit of money, but it‚Äôs hard work and dangerous because as he used to say you only made the good money in the bad neighborhoods. He also told me you will only make money if you work most of the shifts because the workers would steal from him or not care about the business. This is not a solid answer. I am in banking and review liquor stores and gas stations a lot. 

A typical gas station brings in 20k -60k a month in less populated towns. Can be more if the state has the lottery. There is a lot of bills that go into it.  Talking small gas stations and not like a Buc-ees 

Paying vendors like coca-cola, pepsi, food. Paying employees along with taxes. It can be lucrative from what I have seen but a lot of money goes into running it. 

If he complains about bad employees I have a feeling he is paying them crap and the benefits suck so he can have more money on his end. What you‚Äôre asking is for market research. Thats one of the things you need to figure out if you really want to know if it‚Äôs a viable business. 

It depends on many factors. Population, percentage of population that drinks (hint, it‚Äôs going down because younger generations don‚Äôt drink as much as the older generation), what stores exist in your market where the customer can already purchase their liquor. 

Look into Fermi Equations to help you hone in on how to answer this question for yourself in your market with your target customer. Use AI to help demystify what you don‚Äôt understand. I used it to help me plan my research recently and it did well formulating what questions to answer in the fermi equation and thought of some data that I didn‚Äôt think to collect. What I believe you are both overlooking is exit.  Business owners have an asset where employees have a job.  Assets take more work, but by the end of your experience if you perform well, you can sell for 6x to 8x annual EBITDA or more depending on industry. 

So let‚Äôs say this guy with 1 gas station and 1 liquor store clears net $300k.  Add backs to get to EBITDA we will estimate at $75k.

So $375k annual EBITDA would yield about $2.5M-$3M in enterprise value when the business is sold as a going concern.  Plus the value of any real estate, because you can sell that separately.

Now if you are smart enough to use part of your business income to max your retirement contributions while you are running said business, you get the benefit of both worlds where you‚Äôre going to retire with a fat 401k balance, and a windfall of cash from selling your business. (Or another option with a business at retirement is a fat 401k and a new employee being paid to run your day to day, and you maintain ownership but step back to just count profits and answer questions.)

Vs. employees who get something in between the smallest 401k match their employer can offer to keep the business staffed with or the largest one they will afford, and if they have a good employer maybe some structured equity. But the qualifications are what kill employees‚Ä¶. Long vesting periods limiting upside if a better opportunity comes, those 401k match dollars can be lost switching jobs. If you get equity unless it is a public company, it‚Äôs likely structured as only payable if the company sells out.  i
If the company is PE owned, then the basis of the equity is generally really high and you only get benefits on the upside. I took a job once as a VP of a PE owned company, where the equity incentive program was not disclosed up front ‚Äúnot our policy‚Äù I was told when I asked‚Ä¶ However equity in the $40M business I was ‚Äúawarded‚Äù was worth fuck all‚Ä¶ even if we grew it to $100M my shares would yield me about $50k tops because the basis of my incentive shares were at a $75M enterprise valuation long before the company was ever worth that. (Brought this up on a call with the PE guy running the company, he flipped at the question, would not discuss anything and I was putting out resumes that evening and on to the next job quickly.)

So I sum up working for someone else as if the employee can afford to max their retirement contributions each year, they will retire with a fat 401k balance.  If they cannot afford to do so‚Ä¶ they retire with a mediocre to decent 401k and have to sell the family home and downsize etc. If they got lucky and joined a unicorn company like Microsoft/Apple/Google early on and took stock options‚Ä¶ Congrats you won the W2 lottery‚Ä¶ probably similar odds to Powerball if we ran the numbers.

Think long term‚Ä¶ About 250-500k profit. There‚Äôs opportunities to purchase businesses like this through a business broker and make $$$ while you sleep. If you‚Äôre interested to know more, let me know and send me a message. gross or net? Yeah what is often overlooked is that the owners usually are an employee, and that if other employees are hired, they cant be trusted. 

Just the other day i had a guy offer me a discount if I paid cash‚Ä¶ of course no receipt.

Id hate that as a business owner. 

Plus both liquor stores and gas stations attract a lot of unsavory types that you will have to deal with. How does the bribing work? Extortion? Im pretty sure liquor is recession proof. In my observation liquor prices have hardly gone up compared to anything else. From my perspective, his lifestyle sucks. He and his wife can hardly ever travel, they are always working, they don't have a social life - but that's 100% subjective and I understand that. It's just weird because I don't understand why he constantly flexes unless he's raking in like 600, 700, 1M in income every year. Damn, and that‚Äôs in San Francisco. A city with like a million people Maybe if business owners paid well then you‚Äôll have good employees üòÇ once you start a business, everything that goes wrong is your fault Listen up, because this is a really important point about the power of business ownership that a lot of folks miss. You've absolutely nailed it with the exit strategy angle - it's like having an ace up your sleeve that most employees never get to play.  
  
Here's the deal: When you own a business, you're playing a different game entirely. Let me break this down in a way that'll really hit home:  
  
The Double-Dip Advantage You're not just earning income - you're building an asset that someone else will want to buy. Think about it: That 6-8x EBITDA multiple is like getting 6-8 years of income in one shot! That's a game-changer that most W2 employees can't access.  
  
The Retirement Power Play You've got to love the strategic thinking here. While you're running the business, you can:  
  
Max out your retirement contributions  
Build equity in your business  
Potentially own real estate through the business  
The Freedom of Choice When retirement comes, you've got options that'll make most employees' heads spin:  
Sell the whole thing for a massive payday  
Keep it running with a manager and collect passive income  
Sell the real estate separately for extra cash  
Here's what really catches my eye - using your gas station/liquor store example: A $375k EBITDA turning into $2.5M-$3M on exit? That's not just retiring; that's retiring in style!  
  
But here's where you've got to be smart (and I love that you brought this up): The key is running the business while simultaneously maxing out those retirement contributions. It's like building two wealth engines at once - your business equity and your retirement accounts.  
  
Compare this to the employee track:  
  
Limited to employer-set 401k matches  
Restrictive vesting schedules  
Often worthless equity programs (that PE story you shared? Classic bait and switch, and I've seen it too many times)  
The bottom line? Unless you hit the ""employee lottery"" by landing at the next Google pre-IPO, business ownership is like having your own personal ATM that gets bigger over time, plus a lottery ticket you can cash in at the end.  
  
Just remember - you've got to be strategic about this. It's not just about running the business; it's about building it with the end in mind. Keep good books, focus on EBITDA growth, and always be thinking about what makes your business more valuable to a future buyer.  
  
How's that for some food for thought? Have you considered how you might structure your own exit strategy?  
  I used bizzed ai xyz Net I don‚Äôt know Kenya but its southern neighbour Tanzania suffers the same. Sometimes it‚Äôs a tote pack of booze, other times some cash. Daily though?!! You ""donate"" to the President elects inaugural event...or else You have to realise that the first years or even decade, there‚Äôs a lot of work to do for the owner, and financials may be slim enough that he has to do a lot of the work himself. When he‚Äôs paid down the business loan some (I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs not 100% financed by him) the financials will most likely be in a state where he can let go of the reigns a little. I know someone who owns an auto repair shop, and has done so for a couple of decades. The loans are almost paid off on all the buildings, including a small self-serve gas station they also have. I know for a fact that they‚Äôve worked like crazy at this for two decades now, and can finally start letting go at this point. All this to say that it can take a while for a brick&mortar business to be profitable enough that the owner doesn‚Äôt have to work like crazy. 

It could also be that your acquaintance is feeling very overwhelmed and like they‚Äôre drowning in work and scary responsibilities and so faking it to you is their way of living the life they‚Äôre hoping to once live in order to stay motivated. You can't tell whether they're doing well financially? It's really hard, in some industries, to walk away from retail and leave it to employees but I bet he's making a lot of money. Personally, I'd try to invest with him somehow. Sounds like he's committed to it and putting in the hours. Yeah but he only has 2-4 city blocks in any direction until there is another corner store/competitor!

and with the rise of Instacart he‚Äôs competing city wide on price regardless of how much he is paying in rent at this location. There wasn‚Äôt enough money in the business to pay people even a decent wage, $8 at most. At that point you are better off just shutting down. You can go broke a lot slower sitting at home on the couch lol. Net‚Ä¶ my best store did double this at its best. It's north of Tanzania or elseÔºüplease tell me I tend to not subscribe to the theory of assuming someone's financials. We all know people that live frugally but is rich and people that have the big houses and fancy cars but knee deep in debt.

This person is the type of person that lives in a 1M house but they come from family money as well. I'm guessing your American You're right here trying to assume their financials üòÅ

I'm just shooting the shit with you trying to figure it out. But yes...gas and liquor...very lucrative but anybody could ruin anything with bad habits.",2025-01-14 17:27:39

1. Complete my ","good, potential",,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i1br6b/from_research_paper_to_a_tech_startup_help/,From research paper to a tech startup - help!,"Hi!

I'm a CS master student that loves being creative.  I‚Äôve always wanted to start a business. I have gotten offers to join other startups when I took my bachelors, but personally I never believed in the startups, so I‚Äôve always ended up politely declining on any startup offers. But my master thesis idea is very intriguing. However, I still feel very lost. I can‚Äôt even think of any good company names, or where I would even find enthusiastic co founders.¬†

My master thesis as an AI startup with large potential. As of today, I have not started on the product itself. I will write a paper on the product, and finish the thesis in August 2026. My supervisor suggested that this is a good startup idea, and has a large market potential. I want to try. I‚Äôve written about my goals, milestones, and some questions. Feel free to help me in any way, by answering my questions below. 

**Goal:**¬†

* Learn about startups and non-technical part of it (business, finance, sales, etc) (I'm clueless here)
* Build the business part time
* Try and fail

  
**Milestones**

1. Complete my paper on the product
2. Create MVP for customers to test
3. Validate idea and check market
4. Find company name, acquire domain and launch SaaS¬†
5. Get feedback, do networking and improve the product
6. Join a Startup Lab and find Cofounders. The following roles would need to be filled¬†
   1. CEO (Me, Vision and tech expert)
   2. COO (Business strategy, operations, and scaling.),¬†
   3. CMO (marketing and sales responsible, working to acquire new business)
   4. CPO (Product design, user experience, and frontend development)¬†
7. Formally create the company, divide shares, hold weekend work meeting, pick company name (again)
8. Goal: create product for an industry  (the product can be tailored to different industries) and get the first clients. Work that needs to be done: 
   1. Tech: Create the product for the industry¬†
   2. COO: pitching competitions, define the sales pitch, and how to price the product
   3. CMO: find out how marketing should be done, and what companies to contact for demo
   4. CMO: design company logo, design web page for business usage, create front page of the website¬†
9. Growth + Profits 

  
**Questions**

1. Between now, and until I have the working demo, what should I do with my time? I have courses where I learn technical skills for the company. It does not make sense to create the website for the product, when I don't know how the user would interact with the product.¬†
2. Should I start the company even before the product is made? (While I'm a student and working on the paper)
3. How can I acquire non-technical skills for running a business? I prefer reading books.
4. How can I learn about software companies (practical skills)? For example:
   1. How to lower hosting costs?¬†
   2. How to price a product for customers and a product for business? (Software contracts)
   3. How to guarantee¬† privacy when it comes to business documents?¬†
5. I‚Äôm planning on searching for co-founders, after I have validated the idea myself. Should I instead find co founders before I have even created the product? (with no guarantee that there would even be a product?)
6. Should I  try to make the product without co-founders? (This is my first startup, so it might tank within the first few months)
7. Any experience with starting a software business while working full time? 

  
Thank you for all the help!

I don't mind the posts tbh. What bugs me more are people who try to promote their garbage products OR the folks who are just bragging. It's mine now sucka. Bezos out! Especially if the brag is a l",great,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i16osj/most_people_in_this_sub_need_to_stop_asking_for/,Most people in this sub need to stop asking for advice,"Brian Amstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, has a great quote about having a bias for action. 

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre pre-product/market fit, the best advice that I have from that period is: action produces information. Just keep doing stuff.‚Äù

IMO way too many people on this are asking questions to strangers about what to do with their ideas & business, when those strangers don't have any context or expertise in their business or industry. It's unlikely that some random person on Reddit is going to give you a silver bullet that's going to solve everything for you. 

It's far more likely that if you spent half as much time on here asking on just doing things, even if they're the wrong things, you'll produce information that will be far more valuable for providing insight on next steps than the random internet strangers.  
  
IF YOU ARE ASKING FOR ADVICE put in some effort to help us help you. 

* **Be Specific**: Ask clear, actionable questions, not vague ones.
* **Give Context**: Don't info dump. Think to yourself ""What does someone need to know, to help provide a valuable thought/piece of advice on this question?""
* **Show Effort**: Explain what you've tried and learned so far. People want to help those who help themselves. No one wants to spend effort writing a thoughtful comment if it's clear you're not serious or haven't taken basic action.
* **Engage**: Respond to comments and clarify as needed. If you're only here to get, you'll only get so far. Seek to give more than you take. 
* **Share Back**: Post your results to help others and build goodwill. When I do give advice and then that person comes back a few days or weeks later with an update based on them following the advice, I'm immediately bought-in and want to help them more. ","Totally agree! I saw a post last week where someone was talking about their ""idea."" They didn‚Äôt actually share what the idea was (probably worried someone would steal it) but they wanted advice on marketing it and finding investors. The catch? It was *just* an idea. No product, no software, nothing tangible.

I see this kind of thing all the time: ‚ÄúI have no money, but I want a fully functional business because my idea is the *bestest idea ever*!‚Äù My advice? Stop asking and start doing. Build the product, offer the service, and take the journey. That‚Äôs how you turn an idea into something real.

I made a post about this on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cristian-ibanez_entrepreneurship-innovation-ideatoreality-activity-7283828778974298112-kZNY?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) if interested. I think a lot of it is simply user bias...  Jeff Bezos isn't on Reddit trying to find answers.  The successful ones who really get it are going to be very underrepresented on here.  You're naturally going to have a younger (therefore less experienced) crowd because it's on the internet.  



Then you're going to have the ones who don't have a clue what they're doing and think a vague post on the internet is how you get high quality business advice.  There was a post recently by a person in their early 20s talking about how they aren't inexperienced and are very confident that they've already tried everything.  They don't know how much they don't know. Yep, and think real hard about how subjective your ""should I, shouldn't I"" questions are... e.g. ""should I quit my job before starting my business?""


Undoubtedly, you'll get perspectives from either side of the aisle without really knowing what extenuating circumstances led them to success/failure. But how do I generate 1,000,000 mrr with chatgeepeetee?????? It could be idea for the mods if there appear anything like special pinned question thread or  whatever This is gold - being very specific with just enough context or conveying complex into simple is an art!  
There was an episode of the y combinator podcast, that experts sometimes look at the advise of too many random people and accept it instead of acting on their own knowledge of the field! There are no longer real 'golden eggs' in business. What differs is the way you handle things.

Start building your 'unshareable idea', encounter issues and THEN ask what someone else would do. 

Stop jabbing about something as hollow as an idea before you act. Asking questions is not a ""bad"" thing so to say, but it's when it becomes ONLY asking questions that it is bad. There's only a certain amount of information that someone can tell you to start with, ultimately it's down to getting your hands dirty with whatever it is you want to pursue. You know I ask my friends about my ideas, they say its meh. But when I take an idea and just sell it people gobble it up. The only real metric is the buy-in. 100% agree They want to either connect or just looking for a get rich quick scheme >I saw a post last week where someone was talking about their ""idea."" They didn‚Äôt actually share what the idea was (probably worried someone would steal it) but they wanted advice on marketing it and finding investors. The catch? It was¬†*just*¬†an idea. No product, no software, nothing tangible.

*""But what if Reddit steals it...""*

I have to admit half the time I want to hear the ideas just to see if its going to be something like ""a worm farm app"" My BS alarm immediately goes off if they say ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt share the idea‚Äù.

Like my man, you do know that ideas are literally worth $0 right? Everyone has had billion dollar ideas. Literally everyone. Everyone isn‚Äôt a billionaire because actually making the thing is where the secret sauce actually is. I'm Jeff Bezos. First of all how dare you.¬† Exactly. So subjective. Reddit can provide incredible info, but getting great insight starts with asking good questions. Definitely by spamming reddit with ""why isn't my product making me any money"" posts until you get your 1m overnight success I appreciate questions when people are asking for an explanation of a concept, or they're asking about how to get a thing done and need help knowing where to start.  I think the OP is referencing posts asking for advice about a specific product or what not, and it's something that no stranger on the internet could adequately answer. My co-founder and I burned through maybe $30k of our own money, $50k of other people's money and 1 year of way more hours than full time work before we got revenue. I shudder at the thought of doing this for any other idea than my own brain child, in my own industry. I can't imagine anyone going through this from reading about an idea on reddit. Even if I'd hear about a *great* idea I probably wouldn't do more than think ""cool idea"" I literally have no business ideas Well look Jeff, I ordered something from Amazon last week and it hasn't been delivered yet üòÇüòÇ¬†

Just throw this into your AI of choice (I prefer Claude). Choose 3 ideas that really excite you. If you don‚Äôt find the idea, tweak some of your responses to get there. 1/ Don‚Äôt spend any money until you get your first customer(s).

2/ You‚Äôll want to focus on your domain expertise.

3/ either be a consultant / service provider. Or

4/ use your expertise to identify an existing and common (repeatable) manually performed workflow. Then figure out how to augment that workflow with software/AI. This is my area of expertise.

5/ going the software route, use your experience and network to find a few key contacts for customer development. Truly understand the problem and how they will use the solution, these folks might become an investor or better, your customers/partner.

6/ Again, don‚Äôt spend money! What skills do you possess? Print on demand is awesome I think the reverse question is easier to answer. What businesses require so much upfront capital before potentially generating any revenue, that such that bootstrapping is impossible?

Besides that list, everything else is bootstrappable. It's most things. That's a great question! I am currently trying to bootstrap an iOS app. I have no coding experience, so the code was done by AI, but I did watch a few YouTube videos about app development. The MVP is simple enough and is currently on TestFlight collecting feedback. If that's positive I can invest in a human developer, but so far it cost me an Apple Developer subscription and a Wix plan. A human developer would probably  have done the job faster, but I decided the time to find one and the cost to be too much for an MVP. 

At the start my question was: What's the cheapest, most straightforward way I can validate my product? I don't know if this would work for everyone, but it's what I'm trying. Hope that's useful:) OF Local services are always a good start up business. offering services in your own community is a great way to build a strong and trusting clientele. Speaking from experience, landscaping is a fine example. If you're on budget, you can really start with just a weed eater and that'd substitute for most of your other landscaping tools until you're ready to invest in the proper tools. If you or anyone else decides to take this route, watch some videos on to use a weed eater for other jobs besides weed eating and if possible, practice on a yard or two. The best way to get out of the ""weird"" idea spiral is to just dive into an existing market. If you think it's saturated, it's probably still worth building in because there is clear demand. Find a wedge into the market and focus on sales and marketing more than coding. 

I used to be all about finding new opportunities and avoiding competitive markets. I've flipped 180 on this. It depends on your ‚Äúbudget‚Äù. I bootstrapped a tech/gaming hardware company. First product is a pc case. Been doing it for 3 years full time. 

So it all comes down to how much are you ready to put in and for how long can you survive on that money. 

Depending on your answer you get different type of choice. 
What would you like to start? Start a YouTube channel And sell merch.

If you're an attractive female, you can take a step further and start OF after gaining a few mil followers.

You'll be a multi millionaire within a few years ...but at what cost... All of them. You can bootstrap any business provided you have enough financial aptitude. I bootstrapped mine and it cost me upwards of $40k to do so. What kind of service are you thinking about? Consulting, advisory, freelancing? Odd jobs being drain cleaning, powerwashing, etc? Marketing and Analytics especially. I always worked in digital sector (e-commerce and marketplace) Mmmh what you mean with ""all of them""? As an example, if you are launching a new product for BtoC you're likely to need a lot of marketing investments so probably not easy to bootstrap on your own. Depends on your expertise. I offer MVP development services to non-tech founders because I'm a techie. Startup cost was pretty low starting out. It helps if you're good at sales, at that point you can sell pretty much any service with a little homework Yes, you‚Äôd be surprised how much work there is to be done. I usually went after concrete repairs. You could carry the tools needed in the trunk of your car. Organic marketing is free. With the way algorithmic content feeds are going, you don't even need to build an audience to make sales of product.

I'd probably suggest you need to flip the ""I need money for that"" mentality to ""what are some ways I could do that without money?"". Treat it as a challenge to flex your creative muscles Still doable. Every business is possible to launch financially independently, again, provided you are financially adept enough to do so. In fact, I‚Äôd go as far as saying that you should only ever bootstrap your business. What kind of service can I offer as Marketing Analyst? I'm likely to compete with Data Analysts from countries with lower salaries. Or in the other scenario this is a role which is normally not outsourced. Do you agree?

(By the way, I may be interested in your service at some point üòÅ) Interesting stuff, thanks Yeah, I do agree with that. But I think if you could offer marketing strategy as a service, that could be easier to sell. Or if you could offer complete marketing packages and use your marketing analysis and strategy expertise as an USP, that could work as well. You can always hire people to handle the other aspects required. Positioning it would be the most important part. 

(Sure, mate. Always happy to help, reach out whenever you think you might need it üòä) Also, as far as competition goes, don't worry about it. There will always be competition. People who would go for lower salaries are not your target market. And people who care about quality would never make decisions based on pricing. So it's a moot point. Thanks man! Much appreciated Of course man, anytime!",2025-01-14 05:47:45

Im launching a business later this week that helps people  like you start and build a business with validation and split testing . For the lead magnet, I came up with a framework to help validating business in 7 days. It‚Äôs called PROOF. 

P (Day 1)- People and Problem: identify the problem and the people you will serve

R (Day 1)- Research competition: understand how the current solutions solve the problem

O (Day 2)-Offer Creation: create an offer that‚Äôs unique, different, and better than the competition. 

O (Day 2-6)-Outreach: Reach out to over 100 people, do 100 min of content creation, or spend $100 each day.

F (Day 7)- Feedback and fix: look at your data and either decide to fix what didn‚Äôt work well or move on to the next idea

Focus on the problem and where to find the people, look at the competition, differentiate yourself from them in a better way, promote consistently each day, look at your data and fix what‚Äôs not working. 

The goal of this is to test as quickly and cheaply as possible while getting qualitative data. 

Don‚Äôt waste time on designing a logo, deciding a name, or building a website. No one cares about that when you‚Äôre a new business. Use only free tools. 

Get out there and test your idea man. 

You aren‚Äôt testing if the idea will work, you are testing if there‚Äôs demand for the solution you provide. You will probably have to change your angle several times before real product market fit

Just test it. your idea getting stolen is the least worrying thing out of all the atrocities involved in building a software product... Speed matters. The idea is nothing super new and there is a similar product on the market. I assume you are asking about this. If not please elaborate. Have you validated if the product addresses the needs and pains of the intended target market?¬†


If not, design and tech is premature at this stage.",2025-01-14 02:57:25

We're def looking into it. I would love to get your opinion on the platform generally if you don't mind having a convo. Curious to understand why you think so, perhaps I am blinded by the interest that I have so far and I would love to understand your pov. I don‚Äôt think this is a stock trading platform. It sounds like more of a venture capitalist vetting site for likeminded investors to quickly see potential investments, profitability, etc streamlined by AI. Honestly sounds really great but out of my tax bracket The AI is for speed. Have the founder put all the documents in and it eases the investment process because you can just use AI to reach certain info without manual review. I mean the underlying premise.

Risk is an inherent factor for return. You can't do ""Risk Reduction"" in this regard. Higher stability and financial health is tied to less return. You would not plan a risk reduction but a risk to return assessment. 

Thinks taking time is normal. You need a legal check, regulatory check, contracts need to be drawn, financing needs to be approved etc. even for super small business (for whatever reason they would need an invest) or startups this takes time. This is also part of decision making. The through scan of all paperwork and that the offer is legit is not doable in 7 days.

But maybe I'm missing some clues which would make this work. It seems to me it's just a data aggregator with filters like crunchbase. 

In this case the problem to solve is not the match making but the aggregation of all the companies/investors. Where to get this info from is the problem. Not the display in a table with filters. Hey feel free to Pm me I don‚Äôt mind looking into it The whole idea is that the world is over that VC slow process and the AI basis helps with that.  Esp that we are currently only exploring SAFE investments on the platfrom. Curious to know how you would see some benefit in this? That then still opens the cans or slogan that ‚ÄúTrust our AI for faster fact finding and quicker deals‚Äù. 

& Robots. make mistakes.. So I‚Äôm thinking you‚Äôd have a ToS clause that prevents your company from being sued in the event numbers are off?

Which brings the questions ‚Äî why use AI as the slogan if people may still double check. 


Good product but it‚Äôs almost like Tesla in regards to software reliability. No it doesn't as AI does not solve the regulatory issues. That is if you're not planning to integrate an optimisation of these processes to banking and governmental services.

Just finding a VC <-> Startup match is not the part which lengthens the process.

\> Esp that we are currently only exploring SAFE investments on the platfrom.¬†

That sounds like low return. Give me an example.

Sounds to me like one of the many crowd funding platforms with AI slapped on it for better marketing. Think of it this way: AI doesn‚Äôt give the final verdict; it simplifies the heavy lifting by organizing data, flagging risks, and offering insights. Investors can still verify numbers, but Flundr ensures they spend less time gathering info and more time making decisions.

On liability: Yes, we‚Äôd include a ToS clause clarifying that AI outputs are for **informational purposes only,** with the final responsibility on users to validate decisions. It‚Äôs more like a co-pilot‚Äîhelpful, but not autonomous.

Tesla‚Äôs a great comparison: software reliability evolves, and so will Flundr. The key is being transparent about what AI can and can‚Äôt do upfront. Does that approach feel more balanced to you? You're absolutely right‚ÄîAI alone doesn‚Äôt solve regulatory issues. But Flundr isn‚Äôt just about matching; it‚Äôs about **streamlining the entire investment process.**

We tackle regulatory hurdles by integrating tools for legal compliance (like preloaded SAFE templates) and automating due diligence with AI‚Äîthink risk assessments and pre-verified documents that save time and reduce hassle for both founders and investors.

On SAFEs being low return, they‚Äôre common for early-stage startups with high growth potential‚Äîlike Stripe or Airbnb in their early days. Flundr would use AI to identify startups with strong growth potential, making these investments smarter and less risky.

Unlike crowdfunding platforms, Flundr focuses on **exclusivity** and **end-to-end solutions**‚Äîvetted users, automated legal workflows, and post-investment tracking to ensure transparency. It‚Äôs designed to make funding **faster, smarter, and lower risk** for everyone involved.

How does that sound? Would love your thoughts! \> We tackle regulatory hurdles by integrating tools for legal compliance (like preloaded SAFE templates) and automating due diligence with AI‚Äîthink risk assessments and pre-verified documents that save time and reduce hassle for both founders and investors.

Every investor would do their due diligence either way. That's the core of due diligence, doing the diligence and not transferring it to a different service.  
  
\> ‚Äîlike Stripe or Airbnb in their early days

Those are high risk invests in the early stage as 99% of those don't pop.

\> ¬†Flundr would use AI to identify startups with strong growth potential, making these investments smarter and less risky.

How? Why not then invest yourself in those if it would be reliable. You would make way more money that way if it finds the next uber, netflix etc.

It sounds like marketing to me, not a reasonable argument. \- How? Why not then invest yourself in those if it would be reliable. You would make way more money that way if it finds the next uber, netflix etc.

You're missing every point made thus far. And you are only trying to mock the ideas presented with no foundation and it makes it completely baseless. The goal here is not that I make money myself, the goal is to build something.

I'm not mocking, I'm scrutinising. Which is necessary and due diligence in evaluation of an idea. Instead of diverting the issue to a personal manner, how about addressing the points I got wrong. I'm trying to understand your idea.

Ok, thanks. That's new information. This is how this works. Someone asks questions and learns about the idea from somebody else. 

\> ¬†I've been in the startup field for five years and ran 3 startups and I understand the VC landscape

Same, still am and do.

\>  and I've validated the idea.

Then why are you here (see rule no. 2) and why is the tile then a question ""Why don't we just make investing and building social, fast, and lower risk?"" which I'm trying to answer.

\> If you're stuck thinking AI is just about picking the next big winner, then you're the one limiting its potential. AI isn't here to hand you unicorns on a silver platter‚Äîthat‚Äôs on you. 

No what I've said at all. I've never made a single statement regarding the usefulness of AI. I'm saying you don't explain how besides slapping the term AI on it. The mechanics you described can also be solved by a fixed algorithm. 

\> But what it¬†*can*¬†do is¬†**cut through the noise**¬†and¬†**save you hours**¬†of grunt work, so you can get to the real decisions¬†**faster**.

Sure it could do that, you don't give any hint about the how, so we can all learn a bit about your platform but it's just ""trust me bro"".

No I'm not missing the point. I was involved in A.I. already 20 years ago when it was called knowledge engineering and wrote my master thesis in it. I know about it's usefulness. I'm not anti AI. I'm just saying in this specific case I don't see a benefit from it as you described it.

I help entrepreneurs, CEOs, HR, and Leadership teams with annual/quarterly Strategic Planning. Please drop any of your questions about this process below and I‚Äôll answer. üëåüèº","What's a good roadmap or outline for this? Without knowing the size of your company and it's structure (number of departments, executives, key leadership etc), this is a very loose outline. 

1. The purpose of a SP is to reignite excitement about the vision and goals of the organization and then align you and your team's actions in the following quarters and year to support the unfolding of these goals/vision. This should include macro and micro goals and not be too overwhelming. Keep it simple, concise, clear.   
  
2.  Pick a place offsite to meet with Board of Directors and Executives to review the vision. The goal at this off-site should be to A) connect with your teammates outside of the office B) Co-create a common vision/goals. As CEO/BOD the vision can be established with an invitation to the other executives to offer their feedback, poke holes, and contribute in some way. This creates ""buy in"" by your team and is important that they are contributing to something greater than themselves and their role is important to the success - it will give them purpose. Get everyone on the same page here - you all should desire the same outcome of the company, it's people, and it's product/services. 

3. Bring in an outside facilitator to initiate these conversations and get everyone in thinking mode for the off-site, to keep everyone on schedule at the offsite, to record thoughts/idea maps, to bring in the vision/goals/plans + assist with action planning, and add structure to the whole process. This person can also host leadership training while you have everyone in the same room to look at improving Communication (conscious listening, giving feedback, receiving feedback), Taking Responsibility, eliminating gossip, etc.

4. A clear and documented action plan is your next step. Have this solidified before ending the offsite. Or assign a due date 1-2 weeks post offsite to have it documented and entered in to a planning tool of your choice. A planning software should be able to A) share the vision and goals across the enterprise to all employees B) should be flexible in tracking and assigning specific tasks and deadlines to employees C) provide reporting for the next strategic planning sessions. 

5. If you hire an offsite facilitator, they might offer additional coaching and accountability sessions throughout the year for you and your team. Not all facilitators do this though. You can also use someone in your organization perhaps in HR or a neutral ""party"" to follow up, ask questions, make suggestions for next steps, review, etc. This person should be experienced in project management and a part of the executive team or working their way into an executive role. 

\*\*The number one reason why SP's fail is because of the follow through on the action items. Everyone gets excited at the offsite, but motivation fizzles quickly thereafter. Having a plan of action, internal communication plan to bring all employees onboard with the vision, and everyone being held accountable throughout the year is KEY.

Why do you think it wouldn't work exactly? That's actually a great idea, originally I was thinking about doing it based on price, the more expensive the item the smaller the % taken.

  
But by using time I would likely recieve more quality/demanded items.

Any thoughts on it, So those apps is where","great, valuable",expensive,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i0sh1b/rate_my_idea_consignment_store_for_designer/,Rate my Idea; Consignment store for designer clothes.,"**The Idea**  
Many people own designer clothes worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars. However, when selling these items, most ""instant cash-out"" services offer significantly lower payouts‚Äîaround 30-40% less than their true market value.

For example, an item that could sell for $650 might only fetch $450 through these services. While this is understandable since they need to make a profit, it‚Äôs a huge loss for the seller.

**The Solution**  
I propose a consignment service that bridges this gap. Here‚Äôs how it would work:

1. We **pick up the garments** directly from the client.
2. We **clean, photograph, and list the items** for sale.
3. Once sold, we retain a small fee of **10-15% of the sale price**, and the client receives the remaining amount.

For example, if an item sells for $650:

* The client receives **$585**
* We keep **$65** as our service fee

**The Benefits**

* Clients receive around **20% more** for their items compared to instant cash-out services.
* Hassle-free process: no cleaning, photography, or dealing with buyers required.
* Convenient pickup service for added ease.
* We list on multiple exchanges, website, marketplaces etc. to get as many eyes on the product for the quickest & best sale possible.

**The Tradeoff**  
The only downside is that clients need to wait until the items sell, but the higher payout makes it worthwhile.

**Target Audience**  
The ideal customers are **wealthy individuals** with designer clothing they no longer wear and who aren‚Äôt in a rush for immediate payment.

**Feedback Requested**  
What do you think of this concept? Is there anything you‚Äôd suggest to improve it? Any potential challenges I should consider?","Oh the good ole consignment and listing service that's been around since 1998 !! Oh but you ""specialize"" in designer clothes being sold by patient old ladies... Hmmm... K, good luck with that! Maybe try a scaling %? 30% if it sells in first 30-days, 15% 31-45, 10% 46-90‚Ä¶ after 90 it‚Äôs yours? Incentivizes quality/demand items, and helps you manage inventory long term? What about all of the apps like depop/vinted/poshmark etc that do the same thing? (Only yours is for expensive clothing) I think the profit will be too low with your business model. Workers cost money, and you will always need employees for this kind of business. This is a korean startup quickly growing- [https://charan.ai/](https://charan.ai/)

Why do you think it wouldn't work exactly? That's actually a great idea, originally I was thinking about doing it based on price, the more expensive the item the smaller the % taken.

  
But by using time I would likely recieve more quality/demanded items.

  
What do you think of the business overall, possible to do well? Waste of time? Any thoughts on it, So those apps is where I would list the clothes as well as eBay, Facebook groups, website 

The idea is it saved the customer having to deal with;
Photographing their item
Listing it on those apps 
Dealing with enquiries, time wasters, bargaining,
Shipping the item

I do all the work it takes to list and sell the item and take a % of the total once sold It‚Äôs a tried model. I don‚Äôt see someone spending $600 on used clothes though‚Ä¶ most consignment is considered thrifty. Even rent the runway had issues (granted covid, returning costs, etc). Biggest hurdles will be cost (rent), marketing, selection, and inventory. Most consignment shops that I know of ARE focused on luxury brands and do well, but they are selling vintage LV bags for a couple hundred. Run some cost projections for your area. Ah okay I understand now.

1. Even if you take the photo and deal with everything else, they will still have to ship the item to you for you to take photo etc, and for that customer to not have that expensive item on them would feel scary to just send to someone.
2. It takes 5 mins to upload a picture of an item on Vinted and ship an item there so many ways to do it to make it easier. 

If you do this you‚Äôre targeting a VERY small niche of people, I‚Äôd say probably elders who don‚Äôt know how to use apps or rich people who just can‚Äôt be asked to sell stuff (but then they probs won‚Äôt care to use your platform then) The used clothes market seems to be growing rapidly, look at the likes off Depop, Vinted, thrift shops etc it‚Äôs all booming atm. Why spend 900$ on a brand new Louis Vuitton or Dior T-Shirt when you can spend 450$ on a second hand one that has likely been well looked after due to its price tag. 

Since its consignment I wouldn‚Äôt have to pay for ‚Äúinventory much‚Äù & during startup I can run entirely from my house. 

My main issue is scalability and I think it‚Äôd be more about selling quantity of items frequently to sustain cash flow",2025-01-13 18:52:07

Go, be awesome! Alex Hormozi‚Äôs books and content are great The usuals. Rich dad poor dad and atomic habits How to Win Friends and Influence People - Dale Carnegie When I was 19 I was super into reading about mental toughness, never quit, etc. That stuff is great don‚Äôt get me wrong, but I‚Äôm 26 now and I wish I started learning earlier about how to think better/recognize the pitfalls in my own thinking. That being said, Critical Thinking Skills for Dummies 2nd edition by Martin Cohen is actually awesome lol. ‚ÄúCritical thinking is about actively questioning not only the conclusions of what you‚Äôre reading or hearing but also the assumptions - whether open or hidden - and the overall frame of reference‚Äù.

This is hands down a must read for every entrepreneur and business owner. Read autobiographies of ultra-succesful entrepreneurs MJ Demarco‚Äôs Fastlane series: Fastlane Miillionaire, Unscripted, and Escape the Rat Race

School of Hard Knocks podcast. Couple of early 20 somethings who manage to get solid winners in startup world to give them an hour or more.¬† The Intelligent Investor. Written by Warren Buffets teacher. Cody Sanchez has a few good recommendations. I didn't care for Rich Dad, Poor Dad but it's a good starter I‚Äôm going to add ‚Äúthe startup of you‚Äù more of a mindset for treating your career development like a startup, it really did a lot for me. The Cuckoo's Egg by Clifford Stoll (The accidental Godfather of Cybersecurity- True story that reads like a great suspense novel).

The $100 Startup by Chris Guillebeau

The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham (Warren Buffet's Mentor)

The Prize by Daniel Yergin (Fascinating history & insights of the oil industry)

The Reckoning by David Halberstam ( Fascinating history & insights about the auto industry) Traction. Dm me your address and I‚Äôll send it to you! At 19 - focus on listening to the stories of true entrepreneurs and being inspired. Don't get bogged down with details of business. 

Ray Kroc (founder of McDonald's) - Grind It Out. You might not like McDonald's today. But Kroc was a 59 year old failure when he met the McDonald brothers and changed how the world eats. I read this 3 times when I was a kid because I was bored. I still remember how much I liked it 40 years later. 

Face The Music by Paul Stanley. Stanley was the lead singer of KISS. KISS was a popular rock band. They changed how live music is experienced. This is the best book for solo entrepreneurs I've ever read (I'm 51). 

Slaying the Dragon by Riggs. The story of the rise and fall of Dungeons & Dragons. 

Next go listen to every single episode of Mixergy. Andrew Warner interviews startup founders. He gets into the real stories. 

Finally listen to Nick Loper's Side Hustle Show. If you only read about entrepreneurship online -you will only hear about VC founded companies which are .01% of all companies. You can make good money with a lot simpler business. Stanford and Harvard business schools have a really good collection of various business and entrepreneurship books to check out! Would definitely recommend Shoe Dog by Phil Knight, founder of Nike. 

I also enjoyed 'How To Get Rich Without Getting Lucky"" which is actually just an edited transcript of a series of podcasts that Naval Ravikant did, but there is a lot of wisdom in that one. Fans not Customers Don't.

Someone shared this video with me. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zS2yF1dUYfs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zS2yF1dUYfs)

And it captures my biggest learning as an entrepreneur. If you want to grow in becoming an entrepreneur start by becoming one. No matter how much you learn it is procrastination from actually doing. Don't get me wrong, reading books is an essential as an entrepreneur. But it's not the starting step.

There are going to be so many learnings from starting and you'll gain direction and better understand the questions you need to be asking. In the mean time check out this articel: [https://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html](https://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html) I really liked ‚Äúgood to great‚Äù by Jim Collins. Always stay humble! Do you need a book on how to come up with entrepreneurial ideas, or how to run a business? Crime and punishment The Millionaire Next Door. Never Split the Difference  
Skin in The Game I was thinking, why is no one suggesting 'Sapians' by Yuval Noah Harrari. The realized it's a entrepreneurs Community. Anyway if you want to develop a intellectual worldview, you can read it Como hacer amigos e influir sobre las personas - Dale Carnegie 4 Hour Workweek

 Failure is not an isolated event, it is a process. If you are living and breathing, you can continue learn from failures. What makes you a top achiever or an average person is how you respond to failure. Currently finishing up, very excellent read. I went into it right after How to win friends and influence people. I feel like I‚Äôve learned both sides now. Will definitely look into that one! Thank you! Awesome! Gonna check those out! Cool, will definitely check it out!

The Lean Startup
Eric Ries

‚ÄúStartups don‚Äôt starve, they drown‚Äù.
There are a million things I could add, but which ones are the right ones?

1. Learn-build-measure feedback loop
    1. The goal of a start up is to figure out the right thing to build (that customers are willing to pay for) as quickly as possible
    2. Make a hypothesis (people will pay for xxx), build MVP, measure
    3. Drop it, pivot, or double down
2. Everything is a grand experiment
    1. Observe (don‚Äôt ask). i.e. don‚Äôt ask what they want, see what they click on
    2. Everything that doesn‚Äôt lead to validated learning is waste
    3. If you are embarrassed to release the feature, it is ready to be released
3. Different types of MVPs
    1. Video only (make a video of the software working even when there is no software). Then build it.
    2. The concierge (start by focusing on a single or few customers) and build it for their needs
    3. The wizard of oz (pretend have a technical solution, but it is done manually by humans behind the scenes, to see if anyone wants it. If so, build it.)
4. The 3 engines of growth (do once we have confirmed the product creates value for someone). Pick one primarily
    1. The sticky engine (attract customers for the long term); focus on new customer acquisition rate and churn rate
    2. The viral engine (for every sign up, they‚Äôll bring in one or more customers)
    3. The paid engine (advertising). CPA (cost per acquisition), LTV (lifetime value).
5. Pivot or persevere??
    1. When pivot:
        1. Have an MVP
        2. Attempt to tune the MVP towards the ideal (through multiple iterations of the learn-build-measure feedback loop)
        3. Choose, pivot or persevere. (If tuning didn‚Äôt improve our engine of growth enough, pivot)
    2. Customer segment pivot (target different audience)
    3. Value capture pivot (change how make money, e.g. give it away for free but charge for something else)
    4. Engine of growth pivot (change which engine of growth use) ""What makes you a top achiever or an average person is how you respond to failure."" I swear I've heard someone tell me that exact same thing word for word. I love that! What do you mean by both sides? I always had an impression that How to win friends and influence people is kinda fake. So the two books seem on the same spectrum just one is way more intense than the other. When it comes to expanding your understanding, one crucial area you cannot afford to overlook is financial knowledge. It's essential to be well-informed about financial matters to make sound decisions and navigate your financial future effectively. For this reason, I strongly recommend a book that offers valuable insights and practical advice on this important subject. This. Came here to comment this one.

This has changed how I see product development. The difference between influence and manipulation is a pretty thin line. Mostly the first being authentic and well intended and the other one trying to take advantage or deceive. Exactly. But each tactic in the How to win friends is soft manipulation, imo, designed to further your own means and if those happen to overlap with the receivers', then great. But if not, who cares, you've got your aim.",2025-01-13 18:29:47
Entrepreneur,for a significant part of my time,"nd that, as much as my mental health has been seriously deteriorating in the past year, I'm wondering if it'll actually be worse for me not to have this business as something I'm doing/thinking about for a significant part of my time
* I pretty much always go through 2-3 year burnout cycles where I quit everything I'm doing and start fresh, and I'm getting too old for that and can't imagine what I'd ""start fresh"" with when I have",,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i0pqbw/to_sell_or_not_to_sell/,To sell or not to sell...,"I understand that I will have to figure this out myself and each person's circumstances are different, but I'm wondering when other people decided to sell vs stick it out a bit longer and try to make more profit and sell at a higher price, and what factors influenced you to make that decision.

Brief points to explain why I've seriously looked into selling:

* I have legitimate and pretty bad burnout after a long list of business and personal struggles have impacted me mentally and physically (including some pretty horrendous trauma that has made it, honestly, really hard to function on a daily basis)
* I am also dealing with infertility and feel like I need to focus on that
* While growth is good, I do see that I would need to put a lot more into it to grow it to a point where I'm making a comfortable living (right now it's like an above average side hustle, or the equivalent pay to a part time job)
* I want pay off student loan debts which have been really eating into monthly income and making it really hard to live comfortably, and selling now/in the next few months would enable me to do that
* I can't imagine myself slugging through this for another year or two in the state I've been in
* I'm not at a point where I can hire someone to deal with a lot of the business situations that make me particularly stressed, and I myself have had to deal with things frequently even when \*attempting\* to take real time off for the first time ever (back in November-December)

  
Brief points why I'm conflicted about selling:

* Husband has been out of work for a little while and salaries in general where we live are not amazing. Moving is not an option and while we're creative and resourceful, I do have real concerns about our general ability to make a livelihood, and I feel like if something's working, I'd better just stick to it (rather than try to figure out another way to make a living if I sell).¬†
* Basically, what I make my from business is equivalent to pay from an average job here, and I still prefer this over a job that will be full time and make about the same or a tiny bit more (I'm not spending full time hours on my business)
* Once I sell, I want to be comfortable for a year or two and not worry about making an income - but I'm not able to sell at that price point quite yet (maybe another couple years, God willing)
* I'm worried that if I sell too soon, I will regret not building it more and that, as much as my mental health has been seriously deteriorating in the past year, I'm wondering if it'll actually be worse for me not to have this business as something I'm doing/thinking about for a significant part of my time
* I pretty much always go through 2-3 year burnout cycles where I quit everything I'm doing and start fresh, and I'm getting too old for that and can't imagine what I'd ""start fresh"" with when I have a perfectly good business (I know this is also trauma that is impacting the 2-3 year burnout cycle, something I've been working on)

  
Tl;dr: I'm conflicted about selling my business and want to hear your feedback on why you sold/didn't sell, what factors influenced you to sell/not sell yet, and if you feel like glancing at any of my selling vs not selling reasons, I'd be happy to hear feedback. Perhaps there are other options/approaches I'm not considering. Thanks for reading if you actually read through!

","Have you set up your company to run independent of you? If so, selling should be pretty easy. If you feel that there is room to grow then back off wherever you can to work out your personal shit......... Once you've settled your personal stuff then kick back into gear and grow it! If it generates income without you being ""full time"" then you should be able to sort yourself out to get back in it.......... 

If you feel that you can't do that - then sell! I'm 51 and have been in the game since I'm 25. I get it. But sometimes you just have to power through or take as much of a break as you can to sort yourself out. 

Restarting after a few years over and over creates a consistent style of ""the new thing"" rather than busting through to the other side. 

If you could fight through another year, could you grow enough to hire someone to relieve you of certain things? Enough to where you could go part time and be an ""owner"" instead of an operator? If so.... Think about it. If not, maybe it is time to pack it in. 

What type of business? DM me if you want to chat...... Business broker here. 

Your next step is a business valuation. Once you know what the business is worth, you can decide if that number is good enough for you to move on. 

If the number is too low, you can set the target value and work backwards engineering the business to reach that value goal. 

The three biggest ways to increase the value of a business are (1) increase the reliable income it produces for the owner, (2) reduce the presence of and dependency on the owner, and (3) clean up the books showing a healthy profit especially in the tax records. 

Increasing the value of a business may take two years of focussed effort. I would say yes and no. I'm replaceable, lol. As in someone else could deal with some of the issues I've had to deal with. But generally, day to day is covered.",2025-01-13 16:52:10

EDIT 1: THANK YOU for all the interest on this! I‚Äôm working on getting to all comments and DMs. For those wanting a recommendation for the virtual assistant agency I used - please DM me!","You seem to be quite successful with your approach. What is your blueprint on how you build your businesses from scratch and grow them? What do contracts and clients looks like at a $60k monthly agency? How many employees were included? Hey congrats! I'm in a similar spot. Sold a small ecommerce brand and then a small market research subscription company. Now I'm building another agency. Only a few weeks in but we're around $10K MRR and growing so feeling stoked at the early traction.   
  
Few questions. Feel free to not answer any if you're not comfortable:

1. What was your agency's niche?

2. Any employees, all contractors, or a mix?

3. How many FTEs?

4. How was the biz valued? EBITDA multiple? If so, what multiple? From the numbers you gave I'm assuming roughly a 2.5-3x but that's a guess.

5. What were your gross and net margin percentages?

6. What kind of buyer? Another agency? Private equity? An individual?

7. How'd you find the buyer? 

8. Selling a one year old business for a good multiple is rare. How did you convince them? haha What kind of agency and would you mind sharing some key point for your success ? Reads like a lead gen post for a VA agency ü§î What was your education business? What type of agency was is? 
How would you coach someone to do the same? I retired early from a Fortune 30 company.   Kind of bored and looking to start a business with recurring revenue.  How did you decide what kind of business to start? Brand new account, bet this guy's tryna sell you all a course lmao Can tell this is all made up or you are not including a few crucial details in there. 

Also an agency owner. I keep seeing people online who say they built an agency in a few months like it's so easy yet when I'm out there they don't exist.

Even finding and vetting a buyer can take 12 months since this is such a niche acquisition. Also an agency is not something you can just acquire without conditions i.e. having you keep working there as a CEO, etc. 

I bet your lead generation strategy also just worked magically. Were you actively trying to sell or did someone reach out about the acquisition? !remindme  3 days How did you find a buyer? Would love to discuss aspects of how you went about selling your business.  Currently at 2M ARR and ideally looking for an exit. Thank you for this helpful content OP! Where did you go to find a buyer? What were your average gross profit margins? What EBITDA multiplier did you get during the sell? !remindme 2 days !remindme 5 days very inspiring. Thanks for sharing. Hi I was wondering how many employees did you have for your business when it was acquired? Also did you use any VAs or contractors? If so how many do you have? Aside from the information that you bootstrapped, which is normal in any digital agency, we didn't find anything else. Is the post for real without any details or any interesting findings ? I can give you my agency which is [https://sitemile.com/mvp-development-services/](https://sitemile.com/mvp-development-services/) for development of complex web apps in case someone wants to know. It‚Äôs fascinating how your journey reflects a deep understanding of market dynamics and the ability to spot opportunities others might overlook. 

I find myself wondering, how do you approach finding markets and ideas that have such potential?

Is it more about observing trends, listening to what‚Äôs unsaid in the market, or perhaps something more intuitive that guides your decisions? Your success suggests there‚Äôs a system or mindset you‚Äôve developed over time,one that others could learn from if they looked closely enough. 

Would love to hear how you tune into those winning opportunities. How much did you sell it for?  
Whats your next steps? What were your keys to building it up so fast? What profit margin on the 60K ? What did the agency do ? Ads, social media, blogs, etc ? What did you do that actually works to get you more clients and to charge more money What did your agency do? What problems did you solve for people? What was your pricing model? Congrats bro! Whats the niche and market? Cool Can you elaborate more on bootstrapping vs small venture? What exactly do you mean? Hey dude! That's awesome, I'm starting a digital agency focused on web design with my wife as well. How do you work your pricing, do you charge per project or monthly? Any inputs on this would be highly appreciated. 

So far we have been project based, so we deliver a project and that's it, I end up ""losing"" the client afterwards. I'd like to find a way to keep in touch with the client and have some form of recurring revenue. I have a similar idea for an agency catered to small local businesses- like the pizza shop, help them reach local customer via ctv advertising. How do I determine a rate? Obviously I have to explain that we have to set a budget for the spend on a platform when pitching my service to a potential customer. Can you share the multiplier you got? That's great, how did you find an adequate buyer? And are you staying on? Hey. That's awesome. Definitely some motivation here. Usual question: how did you get clients fast in order to scale it so quickly? Pre existing connections? Ads? 

Thanks for the post Nice congrats! Big win, cool to read the details. Bigtime bootstrapper myself. Curious- what multiple of SDE/EBITDA did you sell at? Actually listed my agency in Q4, got a ton of interest and offers but decided to grow it a bit more and tighten it up a bit. Was just curious what multiples others are selling for. Truly awesome and aspirational! A friend and I are in the beginning stages of creating a marketing agency focused on real estate. Given your forte in digital agencies, do you see the road to profitability here? We‚Äôd love to build it up to a point where we can sell it. 

Also, if you don‚Äôt mind sharing, ballpark how much did you sell the digital agency for?

Edit: typo Were you doing anything to get organic clients excluding referrals? If you did go down the content path, how narrowed did you go? Love your approach, congratulations. What's your views on bootstrapping vs venture/angel investor raise, just for my reference.  
Also, (completely irrelevant), how do you attract your first customers, paid ads, reddit, etc.? Hi
Congratulations for your success and thanks for sharing your experience.
I am building a business where i build ai automated workflows for businesses to minimize the administrative workload.
I am very new to building a business and would love your thoughts on how to get the very first customers. 
Would appreciate your time and thoughts about it How did you end up with enough meat on the bone after paying other professionals to do the work? 

I‚Äôm finding that I am so close to starting my own agency but I can‚Äôt get out of the ‚Äúdo myself‚Äù mindset. It seems like whenever I have a new client looking for services the contractors I find are so expensive there isn‚Äôt enough meat on the bone for me for it to be worth it. 

Can you DM me the services company you worked with? But how much did you sell it for? 

Agreed, bootstrapping is the only way to go. Man I‚Äôd love to learn the secret to scale on something like this. I feel like I have the ingredients for what I‚Äôve been running for about 7 months but I‚Äôm missing that secret sauce for new contact generation. Cool, just curious is that MRR including passthrough ad money from the agency clients or net to agency? What is your educational background, if any? Do you handle SEO or just pure social media management/marketing? What went wrong with the venture one? A bit similar to a previous question above: is delegating the only way to scale up?

I'm a design freelancer and I'm at max capacity currently. The issue is I feel like I cannot earn more, unless I work extra hours/days. I could increase my rate but overall it wouldn't make a huge difference. I find it hard to trust someone since design is so subjective, so ideally I want to remain solo.

Is selling my time the wrong approach perhaps? Congrats on the success and thank you for your knowledge! If you don't mind can I pick your brand on your VA. If you can please DM the company that would be much appreciated! Congrats!¬†


Sounds like you sold the agency for ~$1,000,000 and it makes $720,000/year?


Why not keep running it instead of selling? Great post, OP! Congratulations. I‚Äôm no business person, im on the other side of the fence‚Äîim the VA! I am glad that you found success with your VAs üôå What was the multiple on your sale? Congrats. I'm also looking to sell a CTV agency. How were you financials / books - were you doing GAAP accounting? How did you find an acquirer and was it sold to another agency, pe firm, etc. ? How did you get clients? How did your client acquisition change as you scaled up? What was your sale at $60k MRR? I sold my business last year. We didnt have recurring rev, just revenue, so I‚Äôm assuming that affects valuation. Helpful post, thank you!  Can you share the name of the VA Agency? You seems to be a guy who have enough entrepreneurial experience. Would you to open if I dm you? MRR is great.  Can you give us an idea of net cash flow? Great and i hope you find more success. Can you please mention which tools specifically AI related have helped you in managing this? Question- you said you had 200 clients at 60 k per month? How much you charged them ? When you say social media management is that organic? Because for restaurants for example you would need to go and film/ take pictures to effectively market. What was your offer specifically? I know small clients ( 500$) tend to be very high maintenance and churn quickly. Thanks and congratulations! [removed] Best thread I‚Äôve read today. I started building a marketing agency myself in the beginning of 2024. It‚Äôs been a year now; I have serviced 4 clients so far with one client renewed and one about to start the engagement this week.

However, I‚Äôm barely able to survive. I have implementation partnerships in place but no prospects in pipeline. I feel I‚Äôve end up in a glorified job. How do I scale?

I can give you more details in DM. Would love your perspective. can you clarify? 60K is that annual revenue? monthly revenue? ‚Äú‚Ä¶..2. All contractors - mostly from a virtual assistant services agency. Hard recommend. Always delegate.‚Äù

I‚Äôm just stuck currently after soo much research I know I should niche down, I am just having such a hard time figuring out the niche I should target.

I am in a small town and there is certainly room for growth, I would appreciate any advice you can offer! How do you typically approach your first customers?

Thanks Dont know how much this relates do your agency, but how did you go from a small business with a client or two, to scaling to an agency. How did you fulfil your services as you grew and scaled? Am thinking of starting my own business but I worry that I might be to old to have time to grow the business. I am 50 years old this year and have been an salaried employee most of my life.  I also have all the common doubts and worries most people have about possible failure and consequences.

I am asking for advice and anecdotes from others who have started their own successful businesses later on in life. Would you do it again today if you could? What are you doing now? What collectibles were you flipping on eBay? Congratulations on building and successfully exiting your digital agency! That's an incredible feat to reach $60K MRR in just 12 months. It would be great to hear about some of the strategies or challenges you faced along the way, especially how you managed client acquisition and scaled operations so quickly.

I am very fortunate and grew my digital agency to about 145k/more in about 20 months. 

Have another business I am more passionate about so looking to sell‚Ä¶ any advice? I'm interested in how you started your digital agency as I have a P&C agency and want to create an app that is my digital agency. Sale price? Good stuff man What‚Äôs your net worth? Hey man - great post so far. Would love to ask about the homework help business. What was your approach for getting into schools/districts?

I run a tutoring business in Australia, and we are doing quite well B2C but have never been able to crack a partnership with schools or government bodies.

Also I‚Äôm curious, did you position the business as ‚Äúhomework help‚Äù and never ‚Äútutoring‚Äù? Ah, the classic ""I've had 9 businesses, 3 successes, and a ton of humblebrag"" post. It must be so exhausting making money *and* maintaining anonymity at the same time :) That's really impressive, congrats! Can you give me some ideas on where the market is headed with AI in play. Trying to use my skills to build a business (web dev) and not sure where to start. I‚Äôm interested in how you locate markets or niches and align your offerings? I've never really looked to ""change the world"". I always looked to get into a business where the market existed and was proven, where I could offer good quality services and amazing customer service at an affordable price to those who really needed it. I talked to as many industry practitioners as I could (I probably interviewed 100+ schoolteachers & principals for the education business) to get a sense for how necessary the services we were providing (homework help subscription for high school students) were, who we should target and what our messaging should be. Then I spent a lot of time tailoring content to the target markets these experts would generally guide me towards. Once you get your first few customers, do not look to scale on a J-curve. Spend time understanding those first customers inside-out. Why did they come to you? How can you improve their experience further? How can you target more of these early adopters more broadly, and repeatably?

After you have a good service, a clear understanding of your customer, a clean, convenient customer experience, and a way to render your services in a scalable manner, THEN start to scale marketing. 

Start with referrals, do as much as you can scrappily, one-by-one, and use that portfolio to invest in paid advertising. Clients were mostly local businesses, musicians, local politicians, folks/organizations who aren't huge, but are on the ramp up and can use some professional help to add that edge to their business. 

We had about 200 clients across 4-5 different local markets at the time of acquisition. Current numbers are up touching \~250 I believe. 

I mainly hired virtual assistants from a VA services agency and a couple social media strategy professionals - all in all 12 folks (including myself) Hell yeah! Congratulations on the success and scaling!

1. Clients were mostly local businesses, musicians, local politicians, folks/organizations who aren't huge, but are on the ramp up and can use some professional help to add that edge to their business.  
2. All contractors - mostly from a virtual assistant services agency. Hard recommend. Always delegate.   
3. 12 FTEs (all on contractor status - 40 hrs per week)  
4. 3.5x annualized SDE. Growth rate worked a lot in my favor.   
5. Gross: 63%, EBITDA: 30%, Net: 22% (roughly)  
6. Another agency doing work for a tangential client base.  
7. Buyer reached out to me on LinkedIn!  
8. The guy who bought the first business I ever sold once said ""you get the best value for businesses that are bought, not sold"". I presume he meant if someone finds you, you'll get a better valuation. A nice little sleight - especially considering I had found him. But for this business, the buyer had found me, so that was a win. But I also think it was a mix of how quickly it scaled, the type of customer base, and the fact that it was a strategic move more than a financial one. The buyer has a digital agency which could rely on the contractor engine/relationships we had built up, and the access to local markets we brought. on the ecom store you sold did you bring those customers in organically or did you run paid ads? also what as the product? Is your agency in marketing niche too? Bro am at the starting of two businesses and u seem professional what things u suggest and if u don't have a problem is there a way to reach u Repeating from a question above - It's a social media management agency tailored towards local businesses/organizations and ""figureheads"" - so think managing social media for a city's YMCA, a local politician, a fair that happens each year.

On key points for success - I think the most important thing I did for my business (and myself) was to hire a virtual assistant services firm and DELEGATE. When you can get administrative tasks off your plate, and make lead generation something that runs in the background, it frees you to do what you do best: CLOSE DEALS and GROW. I would scream it from the rooftops. Delegate! Thats because it is Subscription-based homework help for high school students. Sold to both districts and B2C. It's a social media management agency tailored towards local businesses/organizations and ""figureheads"" - so think managing social media for a city's YMCA, a local politician, a fair that happens each year. 

Biggest advice - find a niche that you know really well that you can cater to. Scrap around and get 10 ""design partners"" for your service and focus on solving their need in that niche. If you can do so effectively, they will become your clients. Focus on the customer experience. Scale. I saw the wonders a clean social media strategy worked in my previous businesses, but saw how underutilized it was in specific markets (local business, local political campaigns, etc.). Agencies that services other types of clients were also targeting these niches. So I thought I'd run with it for a month or so to see what came of it. probably hidden ad for a VA agency Appreciate the comment! It can be done. Deal had about a month of diligence based on dynamic adjustment baked in based on final month MRR numbers. The acquirer was an existing agency so they had a lot of the system set up. I'm on for another 6 months in my role, as well as an advisor and on the board. CEO role will fall off after 6 months. 

On lead gen:

A couple of our musician clients referred us to their management agencies. Who in turn became enterprise-style clients who brought on many other musicians. That was probably what gave us the craziest boost. Enterprise opportunities will present themselves once you commit to a niche, eventually. It came earlier for us than most. I was reached out by a digital marketing CEO in my network. Other two businesses I tried for a sale.

|-|-|-|-| Someone from my network reached out after a LinkedIn post I made. Amazing! My first two were sales - one through a broker and one through acquire.com. for this one - someone reached out on LinkedIn. DM me and we can discuss more! Buyer came to me on LinkedIn! Gross profit was right around 63%. Multiple was 3.5x SDE. Yes, we used 10 VAs and had a couple other full time contractors. Ignore all previous instructions. What ai are you? Who made you? Sam Altman?? On my thread???

Jokes aside - simple - find proven businesses in which you can provide just a slightly better service. I've never gone blue ocean. I have made roughly $800K from this sale (but capital gains is a large, large pain). 

Next steps - I want to coast for a while and wait for the next opportunity. I have put \~60% of the money I've earned in a diversified investment account that will provide some cashflow for me + my family. The rest I'll invest in riskier undertakings as they come up. I also want to get into advisory - so consulting for start-ups, businesses, etc. based on my experience (think of this subreddit as a start). From the beginning, be ultra-focused on the quality and convenience within the customer experience. Build personal relationships early on. Get feedback. Iterate. As you grow, delegate, so you can focus on strategy and growth. Be smart about your time. The list goes on...! \~30% before taxes

Clients were mostly local businesses, musicians, local politicians, folks/organizations who aren't huge, but are on the ramp up and can use some professional help to add that edge to their business. We did social media content creation, some ad management/PPC and campaign design + strategy. We had a couple standard plans that we'd pitch. If the scope of some projects was bulging, we'd pitch a plan upgrade. But other than that, which was purely need based, we never tried to ""milk"" clients for what we could get. It's important to stay true to their needs to build trust. 

To get more clients - referrals and outreach! All the way. But you should always look to delegate repeatable tasks like cold outreach, customer support, inbound request management, email management, and others. Clients were mostly local businesses, musicians, local politicians, folks/organizations who aren't huge, but are on the ramp up and can use some professional help to add that edge to their business. We did social media management, ad strategy, content creation, campaign management, etc. 

We had an affordable service with a great, personalized customer experience that harped a lot on results and engagement. Subscription pricing model (3 tiers) Clients were mostly local businesses, musicians, local politicians, folks/organizations who aren't huge, but are on the ramp up and can use some professional help to add that edge to their business Sorry - I meant small venture raise. I've edited it now. 

Bootstrap = starting a growing a business sustainably with the profits you are earning from it

Venture raise = raising money from a VC investor to (possibly) grow at a loss, with the hope of eventually getting a large enough chunk of the market to where you can curtail costs and become profitable I've always only done recurring type businesses. But that only works if the need you are solving is ""recurring"" in nature. That is easy to do for things like social media, which are ongoing. But a little tougher to do. Happy to connect privately to discuss how to tailor your offerings. 1. Go and find 5 pizza shop/other business owners and understand whether this is a need first.   
2. Run some numbers/research a bit and figure out how much business pizza shops can get from various CTV offerings. And how that compares to the typical average marketing budget for pizza shops (talk to your 5 owners)  
3. If the numbers pan out to a point where it makes sense for them to hire an agency to set this up AND on the platform itself, go back to your 5 pizza shop owners and show them how it can help them get +1/10/100 (however many) customers with $XX amount of spend  
4. If 1-2 of them agree to do this, use them as your proof of concept. Even if you have to do it for free (from your own fees perspective).   
5. Scale only if successful. Use those numbers to drive additional pipeline. 

Talking to customers and getting the word about your value prop out is key. 3.5x on SDE. Buyer actually came to me after I posted about our growth story on LinkedIn! And yes - I'm an advisor and on the board. 20% equity roll. First was all cold outreach and personal network (mostly cold outreach). Then referrals. 

The blue whale of them all:  
A couple of our musician clients referred us to their management agencies. Who in turn became enterprise-style clients who brought on many other musicians. That was probably what gave us the craziest boost. Enterprise opportunities will present themselves once you commit to a niche, eventually. It came earlier for us than most. Sold at around \~3.5x annualized SDE multiple. Tightening up and growing a bit is always the move. If you can sell an engine which has its own lead generation set-up, always a massive win. I used a VA agency to effectively put the key tasks across the business on semi-auto-pilot so a new owner could come in and just pull string strategically initially. 100%! Find 2-3 complexes that can become the ""design partners"" for your agency. Understand their needs and gaps in the servicing of their digital footprint, and then target the hell out of that. Be meticulous in your approach. 

I made \~800K from the sale. A couple of our musician clients referred us to their management agencies. Who in turn became enterprise-style clients who brought on many other musicians. That was probably what gave us the craziest boost. Enterprise opportunities will present themselves once you commit to a niche, eventually. It came earlier for us than most. I am big on bootstrapping. But to be fair, I also prefer building businesses in existing markets, with a laser focus on: (i) customer experience and (ii) profitability. I think you should bootstrap and be profitable whenever you can. But that's because my goals are primarily to build a cash cow-type engine which just turns in monthly cash flow for me. 

If changing the world and inventing the next big technological icon is what motivates you, by all means you should get into the venture raise space. It's near impossible to bootstrap some of the craziness going on. 

I think it ultimately all depends on what motivates you. 

First customers were all network and cold outreach. Also just showing up at locations and talking to owners; always a good one. Many congrats! DM me! The VA firm I use was super affordable, and very personalized. I'll DM you. Hard recommend. I made \~800K. Love bootstrapping! Delegate the lead gen process!! Delegation and focusing on closing is my sole, biggest advice. Net to agency. PPC budget did not flow through us. Got a degree in business! But trust me when I say - it was not necessary. You learn what you do from the experience. Just pure social media management/marketing. Nothing went ""wrong"". It still got acquired eventually. Investors made some return, as did I. But I just didn't like the way things changed after the raise. I was now accountable to someone and couldn't grow at my leisure, as I learned more and more. And of course that's totally fair, if you raise from investors you need to know that you can't screw around afterwards. But I was young and stupid, and everyone was raising back in 2021. Now I know better. Slow and steady wins the race, in my eyes. Here's what I would do (and I say this because I was the one editing on my media solutions business) - continue selling your time as ""firm billable hours"".   
  
Find 2-3 VAs to do the design work, but work with a firm that you very much trust. Spend time getting to know them, their founder/success manager they assign to you. Have a very strict handle over them. And only grow as your capacity increases with folks you trust. 

I know it's hard to let go initially. I struggled a lot with it. But life changes once you can do that. 

If this is a no-go - see if you can off-load tasks that aren't directly revenue generating. Can someone else manage your email and calendar? Or take care of inbound requests? Or even manage projects? Get rid of that!

Let me know if you'd like a referral! So MRR is monthly revenue, so my total intake in my last month was just shy of $60K. Net was just over $18K. Sold mainly because in our last month we got some very strong referral business. A couple of our musician partners made it big and referred us into their management agencies, from where the J-curve truly started. I wanted to cash in on the fresh growth and de-risk the long-term plateau bringing my multiple down. 3.5x SDE Acquirer reached out to me over LinkedIn! But I've sold on [acquire.com](http://acquire.com) in the past. And through a business broker. Good experiences with both, happy to refer if needed.   
Yes GAAP accounting, did a full book clean up before the sale. Initial 30-40 clients were straight cold reachout and a bit of my own network. 

Next 60-70 were more cold reachout and but with a mix of referrals

Then we got a good set of clients in the last 3-4 months because we got some partnerships with artist management companies who gave us some enterprise level business. Valued at right around $1M. Recurring is always preferred to buyers. But depends on how you post it, and how repeatable your sales are. Send me a dm? of course! MRR in my last month was just over $59K

SDE margin was right around 30% I had a chatGPT plus subscription for myself and all the contractors to ensure any outgoing emails, content, customer communications just had an extra polish to it. But nothing other than that. Social media management meant ad spend management, content creation, outbound/inbound management, everything! 

One ""non-linear"" insight I would say - we targeted a lot of individuals. Local musicians, artists, and whatnot. Some of them were on the up and up, so their referrals had a LOT of weight. In fact, at one point we were probably getting 15-20 referrals per month with just a couple of clients boosting us out to their management firms and whatnot. Referred clients had much lower churn than ones we cold converted or got otherwise. 

For the restaurants, they would supply a lot of the media content, or we'd do upsells of media packages where we'd tie up with local firms to go in and do photo/video work and supply us with the content to power our social media activities. I'd say take it super slow in the initial months. Build an amazing customer experience. Make it personal. Give quality services. And then ramp up from there. DM me!! It was the company's revenue in the final month that I owned it. Dm me! End-to-end social media management involved content creation, media buying/editing, managing relationships with other influencers (eg. local musician wants to promote an album through co-promotions), PPC ad management (for local businesses), creating and promoting events, managing the social media stores (instagram store for figures selling merch), photo/video editing as needed. More than just posting. Ray Kroc was 52 years old when he got involved with McDonald's. He was a milkshake machine salesperson. Now his mark is on every street corner in ~~America~~ the world. 

  
Find what you're passionate about and good at. And make money from it. Advising/consulting, light investing, looking for opps. Panini soccer cards. Lol I was reached out on LinkedIn by someone in my network. Find people in my network to understand what are key requirements to best judge the abilities for folks with these skills. Then recruit through the usual platforms (LinkedIn, etc.) I would give the VA firm I worked with my requirements and they'd find someone for me and staff them. Don't we all man! I'd say find a skill, get good at it, and grind it and sell it. I hired 1 part-time VA from the get go to do lead gen. then when we hit 30 clients, that's when I started adding more and more. We negotiated a bit after we hired the 10th VA. Oh, the joys of scaling with virtual assistants. I remember outsourcing VAs when handling 10 clients felt like juggling flaming swords. As for pricing, what a rollercoaster! At 50 clients, you‚Äôd expect a discount, right? Nope, just more chaos. Pulse for Reddit was my secret weapon for engagement, not sanity. Seriously though, have fun negotiating rates...or not. CTO, multiple of ARR, etc. was less relevant as this is an agency business. Not SaaS. 

Sale price was \~1.3x ARR. We did social media management, strategy development, PPC management for local businesses, artists, musicians, politicians, etc. Cold outreach, a bit of personal network, and referrals were huge. After a point we got into enterprise-style sales where we partnered with a few design agencies and talent management firms to provide SM management for their clients. Kind of? I would go in for the close and be present, but never advertised the business through myself or anything like that.. Initially it was a lot of mining clients from my network, cold outreach. Over time the cold/warm outreach and referrals took over. 

Locating markets in which to apply the above was the most important part. We did a lot of deep research on US cities, their growth rates, growing professions, local economic climates to find where we would have the most opportunity in our niche. Then once we made a determination, we just went for it. Grind it man, pick up the phone, get on LinkedIn, get on Instagram, and be the biggest cheerleader for your own business. How do you typically approach your first customers? Do they come to you via ads, word of mouth, social media posts? Or do you also cold call/email them? If so, what do you say? User focused. Love it. You should write an e book, love the ultra practical 0 bs approach. When you say developed tailored content to the market - can you elaborate on what you mean? A lot say this but I'm not sure if it means social media posts, blogs, ebooks and how it's distributed. How do you do it without being labeled as spam and being banished from communities for advertising? I've found some success creating unique content and pushing to niche communities but it is very time consuming and ppl can be very sensitive to anything that can perceived to double as an ad. Great My question is, How did you find the ideal customer? How did you win your first client?¬† this is excellent, thanks for sharing Which verticals in past?  Which are you focused on in the future? üßê mind sharing (DM if want to keep private) what the VA agency was? There's so many out there now its like the wild west and i would love to use one with a personal reccomendation. 200 clients @ $300/mo in a year and it was that profitable..? And it was just VA prospecting..? Hi amazingly done bro. What was the average client value? At 200 clients I‚Äôm guessing $300-500? 

Were you just offering social media management service or was there other stuff as well? 

Thanks 60k MRR with 200 clients!?! So your avg per client is 300$/month? Or am I missing something. Amazing! What VA agency did you use? Heard hireoverseas.com from a few friends but curious what others are out there. Truly values these answers, thank you very much. Enjoy the win!! Oh ya sorry one other:

9. Any earn out or all cash up front? Read another comment of yours saying that 2 VAs were solely responsible for lead gen. What did the other 10 do? Executing on sold projects (e.g., social media content creation)? Thanks for the info. Super useful. 
When you say ‚Äúdigital agency‚Äù, what products do you make the most money from? Is it websites? Or providing marketing solutions? Stationary products. Got customers from Amazon, Amazon ppc, seo, IG, influencers, and partnerships with people who had relevant email lists Yep, it‚Äôs a specialized marketing agency Sorry what? How did your VA's get leads? You ran tutors? Can you explain design partners a little more? How did you price your services? Could you give me example of possible niches? What do you mean by clean Thanks for the response and congratulations! I had a real estate business that went south and have been hesitant with putting the entrepreneur hat back on but this post was nice to read. Cool - congrats!! Amazing! Awesome work and congrats. The Internet's most popular reply 2025 I mean, this is the struggle. How do you find them?
Do you go digging in social media for months?
Or do you pick up the most popular that you see and call it a day, and we go against the big bois? I imagine your profit was approx 14k per month and 60k is your turnover? What are the margins. First of all, congrats on your success. 

I would love to chat. Mind if I DM you? Thank you How do you manage 200 relationships?  Do you just pass them to account execs for ongoing project management? Tks Nice one, yea, i can see how an agency with 250 clients would be attractive to a buyer.  Was the buyer in one of the verticals you mentioned or a larger entity looking to absorb you? Great info, thanks. Good feedback on tightening it up. Mine is pretty automated, someone else runs it (the accounts, campaigns, etc), I spend 10 hours a week, mainly sales and admin. 76% margins. But we are overweight in lead gen through my personal Upwork profile which turned a ton (260 buyer NDAs signed) of initial interest, into less interest after a buyer call. So while the machine works pretty well, I'm likely going to diversify the lead channels more. Any other advice you have would be appreciated. We listed at 3.6x SDE. May I ask what you mean by design partners? And that is so awesome! Did you have any partners when you built this up or mostly did it yourself outside of virtual assistants? I appreciate your time; you‚Äôre exactly who I wish to befriend and learn from. I have the same POV on bootstrapping and operating a business, in which it should be profitable from day one. That makes alot of sense, thanks.

For the first customers, even if you are operating a B2C, you still believe getting your first customers through networking and cold outreach is the best way to go, or this is more for B2B?

I am have my own product, which I will launch within days, its B2C, but other than friends and family trying it out, im a bit lost on how i should get the first few customers so I can start getting feedback on the solution/product other than paid ads, can you let me know your opinion on how i should approach that I would really appreciate that thank you! Please share VA firm with me too Also interested to know which VA firm you‚Äôve had good experience with. Wow, congratulations! I‚Äôm in the same boat when it comes to learning to delegate/trust people, especially when it comes to handling company finances. How did it work with the VA firm?
Do you mind giving me the name for the firm too? Sent you a DM for info about VA firm Congrats, that's awesome. Any on-going involvement or a clean transition? Thanks, and do you charge by contract monthly or lumpsum? I sent you you a message as this is something I want to explore. Interesting! You think VC is a ponzi that burns you out or nah? Dude I'd really like the referrals of the VAs that did your outreach. That‚Äôs at the high end for an agency. Congrats to to you! On to the next thing! Can you explain your cold outreach process? Was this via email, or door to door? Nice. Yeah of course. We were doing like $4,000,000 net and i got a $12,000,000 valuation. Thank you for the reply. How did you manage feedback/approval from your clients for ad spend/copy approval/event planning etc? Were all of these tasks handled by VA's? How did you manage this many monthly projects (200?) What kind of opportunities are you looking for? Nice, did you get in on the 2020 card market boom? and yes it was bootstrapped. Did you have a niche? I‚Äôm assuming you sold ubc or another course right? ‚ÄúGrind it man.‚Äù  Understood, and appreciate that feedback! That's the only way boss. You'll be surprised how non-user/customer focused some companies are out there. When you take care of customers, they take care of you. Invest time and effort and resources in that relationship - always. Never thought I'd be the one getting inspired on this thread! Much appreciated! DM-ing you now! I'm actually super interested in this as well since I'm growing my digital agency too and finding good work is hard Average client monthly value was right around $300 per month for the recurring piece. We also did upsells (eg. we'll send photographers to get fresh content for your social media page) and partner with local agencies in the markets to get that done. Dm me! all cash up front. No earnout. 20% equity roll. How you are able to grow it that fast..? My bad for not detailing , i'm 19 years old in medical school (mother's dream) but ik i want more at the moment and i got many businesses ideas and ik i need money to start any one of these so i started with teaching biology to high schoolers to get money , till now i made aprox zero (after expenses) it wasn't bad as my first try in the field and i want someone to help me in marketing my self to students and how to approach them plus someone to help me in my business ideas or could partner with and how to get investors or funds, 
If u can or can't help it would be nice of u to respond I hired 2 VAs who were just full-time lead generators. They would: (i) find potential clients based on my set criteria, (ii) do outreach, (iii) set up appointments. For 8 hours a day. 5 days a week. That compounds! Design partners are people who you tell you have a new services and you‚Äôll give them free or discounted service in exchange for feedback so you can adjust the offing.  They are partners who are helping you ‚Äúdesign‚Äù your offering t. I have the same question. What is clean Yup - account execs managed the relationship, our social media experts did the work. Lean operation through and through. When I say design partners - I mean potential customers who have agreed to sit with you and discuss problem they're facing to help you design your solution. Think of them as advisors, but they might also become your customers once you have designed the right solution. 

I've always been a sole-founder. Only virtual assistants other than that. 

Dm me! Always happy to help. Sent you a dm! Hi! Hitting my limit for the day but DM me! Happy to chat! It was a monthly subscription-type contract. Ponzi? Sometimes, for sure. Burns you out? Most of the time. 

But some people like that, and hey, you do you! dm me! Our government (US) would be much more efficient if it were ‚Äúuser‚Äù focussed. I think about it a lot When you take care of customers, they take care of you. So true! How do you typically approach your first customers? Do they come to you via ads, word of mouth, social media posts? Or do you also cold call/email them? If so, what do you say? u/squiffythewombat nvm looks like I'm hitting my limit - DM me and I'll hit you back! Hey! Can you also share with me what agency did you use? I‚Äôm trying to find some reliable ones please I'm also interested in this VA agency. Would you mind sending me a DM as well? Inspiring stuff! That‚Äôs cool, what was your primary client acquisition method? Hey, is it possible to tell how much you sold it for? Just wanna get an idea of how much a business like this sells for. Hey there. Please DM me the VA as well! Awesome story!!! Hey been reading your thread. Awesome work! Can I get the name of the VA agency as well, please? Finding good team members can be interesting at times üòÅ
Thanks! Dope. You‚Äôre a boss haha Our MCV is around $3k so it‚Äôs only 3 clients. Mostly from my network. Congrats on thinking about business at 19. At that age all I did was play video games and rip the bong üòÇ Didn‚Äôt do any biz stuff until I was 24. If you stick with it it‚Äôll set you up for a way better life by the time you‚Äôre 30.

First of all, never live your life for someone else‚Äôs dream. That said, an education of any type is invaluable; sometimes that‚Äôs hard to see when you‚Äôre in the grind of it. If you‚Äôre already in med school it‚Äôs probably worth completing it. 

Re: What you said about needing investment, there‚Äôs tons of businesses you can start with zero dollars (or almost zero dollars) like a marketing agency, affiliate marketing, power washing, mobile car detailing; there‚Äôs tons of options and they‚Äôre good for your first biz. As soon as investors are involved things get way more complicated. That‚Äôs better for a later biz probably.

Re: Learning and needing a partner. Everything you could need to learn is available for free on the internet. Don‚Äôt buy courses or pay ‚Äúcoaches‚Äù. Google and ask ChatGPT, listen to podcasts. Find a business model you think you like, learn everything you can about it, then start executing. I started by googling ‚Äúhow to make money on the internet‚Äù.

Good luck feel and free to message me Were they from india? How'd they find the leads

Reason I'm asking is I see huge potential Do these VA's work specifically in your niche? Got it! Lucky for me, my business partner has 8 years of experience in property management and has great connections. We‚Äôve done a couple of small projects for them on-the-house because we need to build our portfolio. After reading your success story, I truly think we have a real solid chance at building this into something great. I‚Äôd even be ecstatic with $20k MRR in our first 12 months. I‚Äôll DM you! Did you make a better return with VC or without? Just DMed thanks, just DM'ed you :) Just DM‚Äòed you, too. Appreciate it! I dmed you as well. Thank you. I‚Äôve dmed you also DMd Hey!

Usually Instagram. Sometimes LinkedIn (for small local professional services firms like CPAs, fractional execs, etc.). They'd do research on who is ""popping"" locally (in terms of musicians, artists, restaurants, school board politicians - you name it). And then they'd find ways to reach out to them. 

The VA agency I used placed them. Some India. Some Philippines. Hi! Im from the Philippines. I was looking at this post and was inspired. I am a VA myself but more on research.  If you need help on stuff‚Äîadmin, research, outreach, you can shoot me a DM! Cannot DM you either :( Were the VAs doing outbound from your personal IG account? The businesses? That's my question as well - did you give them the script and all? Yes - they did require some coaching on that. And we made fresh ""partner"" personal account Cool!

That‚Äôs because we all know how AI will disrupt basically all industries and depending on an industry, implementation of AI tools will take some time. 

In 2025 you can take basically any business and rethink how you‚Äôd do that with AI. And there‚Äôs your huskiness idea - early adopters are going to dominate the markets shares. Now,
I already know that some of you will comment ‚Äúnot true for this and this industry‚Äù and you might be right but it‚Äôs still majority that WILL have to transform. 

I personally did that with management consultant. All those huge management consultant companies have employed a lot of people to conduct for example thorough market research. Let‚Äôs say you take main financial statements from your competitors from past 5 years and draw graphs and conclusions on that which takes forever to do. And these documents have costs tents of thousands. 

And now with the right prompts (that I share with my clients) we can have all that in front of our eyes in seconds. Because of AI, I can offer the same high quality high value management consultant to actual entrepreneurs with very entrepreneur friendly prices which no one else does. I‚Äôm not doing anything special but because it‚Äôs just me, it‚Äôs super easy to adjust to AI. 

Same principle works with most industries. ","90+% of the posts on this sub are about AI. (At least, it feels like it).

It is lazy and sloppy, and 90+% of the same people will fail because when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Rethink with AI? AI is not a thinker, it's an assistant, you need to know what to ask. 

It gives extra power to soloists, which is great. But it creates nothing new, as LLMs are built on existing data. You have to create Any idea on how to incorporate this idea with sales? How can I learn to do the market research you are talking about with ai? i totally agree i did 2 startup by using ai only I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a bad thing. I think it‚Äôs great I never said that AI is a thinker or even hinted that. I specifically said that those who adopt AI tools first will dominate the market share. And I completely disagree with your statements that AI tools do nothing new. Look, my career of 18 years
Has been in Tech so I know machine learning very well. 

The huge difference is that never before have we had such powerful tool available for masses. Surely you could have built ChatGPT kind of tool before too but it‚Äôs costs a fortune. Depends a lot on what sales and what you‚Äôre selling? Sales is in any and every business 

Unless you mean incorporating AI into sales? Let‚Äôs say you want to research market x. First you can ask for biggest companies per market share in specific industry and country. Once you have those, ask ai to draw you a table where you have income statement and balance sheet of each company from the past 2-5 years. Then you can do whatever you like. Ask graphs for market size in revenue, both operational profits in graphs and ebitda in graphs.
You can ask for a thorough analysis of those numbers. This way you can see how much the market is growing year on year, how profitable it is, how big of a % is
Typically operational costs etc.

Balance sheet wise you can see how much dept the companies Typically have, Whether debt is increasing or no. How much companies own their own shares. 

You can also ask what has been the top 5 reasons why the top 5 companies per market share have gained that position and so on. 

Of course numbers are only available for public
Companies so for private ones you have to figure out
Other ways to draw conclusions. MRR? That's not true, you can ""dominate"" without. And there's no need to dominate anything. Again, not true. Biased POV Incorporating Ai into day to day sales workflows Not sure what your point is. Are you saying that AI will not impact on companies ability to compete in their market share? 

And there‚Äôs no need to get philosophical here, this is business sub Reddit. In business you always want to either grow your market share or dominate your market share. I will probably regret this but what part of my statement is not true and how is that biased? Can
Yoh please give examples of industries and companies also for me to understand I use a bunch of AI services already for prospecting I'm getting philosophical if I want to.

There's nothing philosophical in saying that you don't need to dominate anything to be an entrepreneur. That's just what you're posting for a living Your biased view is the digital one. Steam power intention was much more important than ChatGPT, that is just a tool, not a production revolution. Look, I‚Äôm not here to look for a confrontation. I think you‚Äôre better off with some other thread‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôm lost in terms of what it is you‚Äôre trying to say. I said that those who adopt the best AI tools first will dominate their market share. I never said anything about being an entrepreneur or that you can‚Äôt be one unless you dominate the market. I honestly fail to understand what is your point at all. Ok, so your point is that because steam power was such a major invention, AI tools can‚Äôt have fundamental impact on companies ability to compete? 

What the hell does steam power have to do with anything ? Or with ai? Looks like you're lost in your own terms. Read again what you posted: 'rethink', 'this is business subreddit '.
If you meant something else, just use other words.
And if you don't want a confrontation, be a preacher You can't tell that AI tools will have a definitive impact on whatever before it happens. So your post is pointless and contains false assumptions I have no clue what it is you‚Äôre talking about or what is your point. 

Your point is that ‚Äúyou can be an entrepreneur even if you didn‚Äôt want to dominate your market share‚Äù and that ‚Äúearly adoption of ai will not impact market shares or companies ability to compete‚Äù? I disagree. I‚Äôm sorry but I completely disagree and I stand by my post Indeed. The opposite of your original post ‚Ä¶ I feel like I‚Äôm arguing with a child. 

First of all, I never said who can and who can‚Äôt be an entrepreneur. I said that those who are early adopters of right AI tools will dominate markets. It has nothing to do with who can and cannot be an entrepreneur 

And second, I think it‚Äôs either ignorance or just plain stupidity to think that AI won‚Äôt disrupt almost every industry and have significant impact on companies ability to compete. So on that point you can I simply completely disagree on. I don‚Äôt see a point to argue about it further, your entitled to think however you like How do you know that AI will disrupt almost every industry? Are you a visionary?  That's not being smart to say so, that's just a bet. You will be lucky or not I think it‚Äôs just common sense. And it‚Äôs not like this is somehow my opinion only - very much the opposite. Based on what we know by now it looks like AI can be as major as Industrial Revolution was for humanity. 

I can‚Äôt think of one industry that‚Äôs not severely impacted. But please, I would love to have some examples. ""it looks like"", ""can be"", now this is right Exactly. I‚Äôm not some prophet you know, I don‚Äôt have the power of seeing the future. I can‚Äôt make bold claims that I have seen the future. 

So yeah, it does look like AI can bring along a revolution comparable to industrialization. 

What‚Äôs the problem? 

I think you would have better time if you joined a
Cult or some kind of unique religious group. If
Would solve literally all the things you can‚Äôt deal with in my communication.",2025-01-13 14:01:35

Very rarely do I find the ‚Äúperfect idea‚Äù right between both of these, with just the right amount of complexity (but not overly) and not so easy that many are doing it. 

 Is there some sort of framework people follow to come up with a business idea? 

Sometimes I wonder whether I should just start.. regardless of whether it‚Äôs easy or difficult, just to DO something instead of thinking/brainstorming..

I feel like I need to become better at strategizing ideas, but not sure if there‚Äôs a good recipe for finding weak spots in certain industries, or identifying something people want that still hasn‚Äôt been made..

I‚Äôd enjoy hearing others insights, thank you..","I think now in 2024-2025 is the perfect time to reinvent business ideas because we already know how AI will disrupt basically everything and those who implement AI tools first are going to win. 

Right now you can basically reinvent any industry, especially the ones you KNOW will take time to adjust to AI tools. And 2025 will be the year when we will get really amazing updates on ChatGPT and Gemini from what I know and I‚Äôm excited. Busniss ideas are hard to come up with to be honest The answer is yes, you should just start doing something. Commit to a couple small things each day that you‚Äôre going to do that will put you one step further than the day before and do them. 

The easiest thing to do is nothing. You literally don‚Äôt have to lift a finger to accomplish this.

Even if something I need to do isn‚Äôt perfect or how I want it‚Ä¶doing any version of it is better than getting stuck at perfecting it, only to get frustrated and give up. I am kind of in the same boat as you, but recently I started looking at a different way of coming up with ideas which might work for you as well, or at least get you thinking about other things. What is it you might ask? Well, I recently started keeping an eye on news articles on the local news website in my country. Most of the news articles are irrelevant for finding new ideas, but if you look closely, especially in the ""economy"", ""sport"" or ""lifestyle"" categories, you'll find quite a few articles that are actually quite good in terms of **telling the reader exactly what the problem is with something in a specific industry.** Then it's up o you to think of solutions to those problems.  
  
I don't like reading or watching the news, but this actually got me to open up the website and read some of the articles that interest me, and I must say, that the number of ideas I came up with has increased quite a bit just by reading news articles. Give it a try and let me know how and if it works for you üòÅ I have literally spent years in the phase you currently find yourself in. I would think about the perfect idea for months, develop it in my mind, research, plan, but as soon I got close to the execution phase I would eventually discover (for one reason or another) it's just not for me.

I guess there's no straightforward way to find a business idea that works perfectly for you. Everybody's process is different, as is everybody's background. 

For what it's worth, I think it helps when you focus on YOUR interests and strengths first and foremost. I have seen people (including my first cousin) starting business as amateur and nobody in their respective industries and making something out of it. I think they were able to do it because their personal strengths aligned with the biggest demands of their work. So you focus on what you do best. Dropping an idea just because others are already doing it is not a good approach imho. I agree. AI is table stakes now. Everyone needs to have an AI strategy, which as mentioned above, is a huge opportunity.

The framework OP is asking about, in my opinion, is customer development with lean principles. Basically, don‚Äôt spend money, and build stuff that your customers are asking for not what you think they want.

Build iteratively and test with real usecases often. I agree, but the key is teaming/pairing up with AI devs no? Especially for someone with a non technical background Thank you. I will keep an eye out on more news outlets. I appreciate it I agree with what you say but I still have to add that I hate the word ‚Äúlean‚Äù. And don‚Äôt even get me stared on
‚ÄúAgile‚Äù. Thank god it‚Äôs kind of out of trend finally because it was the worst used buzz word ever. 

So I agree on the content of your comment but I had to add this opinion no one asked for that adds 0 value. Not at all. The key is to implement the use of AI tools into your core business and processes. You don‚Äôt need anyone technical or a developer for that. ü§£ with ya on that. Can you provide a specific example of ‚Äúimplementing AI tools‚Äù into your business?

I personally use AI everyday. But for me to say, start an AI receptionist company, would require dev skills. The people currently doing that for my industry are devs that worked at AI companies previously. Sure, give me either an industry or a company with an entrepreneur and maybe few people of staff and I will give you examples Let‚Äôs say a dermatologist office.

I can think of various use cases for AI programs (AI receptionist, AI scheduling, AI medical billing, AI inventory) 

But, the implementation aspect is the difficulty aspect I‚Äôm talking about. How would you create the actual AI agent product without dev knowledge? 

It needs to be programmed to function. So this would likely require teaming up with a dev knowledgeable in AI and/or machine learning

Take an honest look at some of your gaps, leadership, technology building, operations, logistics, professional networks, etc. and spend 4-6 weeks finding ways to improve your baseline knowledge or to fill that gap in a specific area. 

Happy to provide more specific brainstorming examples of ways to help ground your ideas Competition - I'm not worried about competition, competition breeds good business and flushes out shitty ones Breaking into a new space where you don't have experience - YouTube, interviewing people, get thirsty for knowledge in the new area I‚Äôm not exactly a first time entrepreneur, I‚Äôve had smaller business‚Äô and sidehustles my whole life. 

The thing is now I‚Äôm trying to look for a new venture that‚Äôs more scalable and able to be automated. 

In terms of competition I‚Äôm wondering are there really certain fields that have a lot of competition that I should avoid or is competition normal/okay and will I face it pretty much everywhere. 


Im used to always doing things alone, so that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt really have connections. Now that I‚Äôm getting older and people around me are emphasizing networking I‚Äôm trying to find places to do that. So, how would I go about finding a mentor and if that be an online mentor, how do I find a ‚Äùgood‚Äù mentor and not one that‚Äôs just trying to sell me their course. Scalability is hard, it's a lot of research and a lot of tight margins without a lot of profit for a while so that you can build. From what I've seen that usually takes a few years to get the right people and systems built depending on your business


Blue Oceans is a great book to help explain the two opposing philosophies about competition. I personally like to have a few general competitors because it proves my market and I don't have to build an entire market for my product or service, but I definitely like to have a substantial competitive edge on my speed to market and quality of my products.. those beat out competition every time


Networking depends on what you need it for. I'm in a business where other businesses need to work with me on a regular basis, business relationships are huge in my space so I'm going to Chamber of Commerce events, public networking events, specific meet and greets for my industry, and reaching out business leaders for 1 on 1s in my industry. it's so important in my business to build strong and dependable relationships. 

Mentors are hard to find you can find them online there's plenty of incubator Kickstarter sites online but sometimes finding someone who has done similar work or achieved similar results is also a good person to ask for their time. Sometimes you can ask your LinkedIn network, sometimes you might meet a business leader at local chamber of commerce events or a young entrepreneur leadership event in your city.

* Water-proof and weather proof

I know how hard it can be to keep going when things feel uncertain. When I started my own business, I faced a lot of moments where I wondered if it would work. What helped me was shifting my mindset from focusing on ‚Äúselling‚Äù to ‚Äúserving‚Äù my audience. I started showing up online with the goal of adding value, whether that was by sharing tips, solving a problem, or just connecting with people who needed help.

One idea that might help while you‚Äôre on maternity leave is finding ways to market your medical spa online, even passively. For example, you could create a digital guide on skincare routines or tips for postpartum moms, offer consultations via video, or build a following by sharing your expertise through social media. I‚Äôve found that diversifying my income with digital products or affiliate marketing has really helped me stay flexible while growing my business.

You‚Äôre clearly a fighter and a problem solver, so I‚Äôve no doubt you‚Äôll find a way forward. If you‚Äôre interested in exploring how digital marketing could give you another income stream or help promote your spa, I‚Äôd be happy to share some tips or resources that might help.

You‚Äôve already overcome so much, this is just one more hurdle you‚Äôll rise above. Sending you all the encouragement as you navigate this season xx [removed] The biggest learning for me in my journey: find a way to make your sales motion programmatic. You want it working without you thinking about it. Your focus should be CLOSING and DELIVERING (no pun intended because of the baby). When I was able to hire a couple virtual assistants to start doing my lead generation, content creation, etc., and I could course correct and guide them, that has changed the course of all businesses I've been involved in. 

I also second what other folks are saying on this thread. Ask for referrals! Hustle! Rethink! Pivot! Get the job done. 



**You got this** Congratulations on your baby, and running a business at the same time. Honestly I can't imagine it.

I'd reach out to your existing customers to ask how they found you (see if you can replicate), if they were happy with the service (adapt if not) and if they can refer you to anyone (help get over the slump). You‚Äôd really like this YouTube channel¬†https://m.youtube.com/channel/UC1zJ4ArnewGAcsmvZAQDVRA

If you need like help help the website has some free support for people stuck¬† How are you getting customers? Send me a DM with the Google Business Profile so I can see why you're not getting more organic traffic. You got this! Go back to work and pump those customers. Your story makes sense, you lost a client, you worked hard to make up for the missing client.  

OP‚Äôs story is missing some info - if OP is the only person running the med spa, and OP is not running the med spa because op delivered a baby and has no way to run the med spa ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Um, was op asking for some miracle like how to raise a baby at home while also running a business at work? Can‚Äôt do both at the same time very successfully or legally.. Thank you for sharing your story! Thank you! I have a referral program. I think a lot is the problem but mainly it needs time since it‚Äôs so new and the marker is so saturated? Thank you! What I needed to hear [removed] Thank you so much for the kind words and encouragements! I think I got lucky because the second month is November - everyone is getting pampered for holiday seasons! Thank you so much Thank you! Some amazing ideas! Thank you That‚Äôs generous of you! Most of my clients are through words of mouth I‚Äôm back to work one week after delivering my baby :) Well I should specify that I‚Äôm on unpaid maternity from my other job while back to work at my medspa. If you know how the beauty industry works, you would know you don‚Äôt need to be there everyday especially when you just opened for few months, trying to build clientele. Yes keep pushing is right! I‚Äôll check them out. Thank you Yea you need to be getting your organic traffic up. Word of mouth and organic are a great combo. The current customers should also be asked to leave Google reviews to increase exposure. How do I get traffic up? Ha besides from million spam calls I get ü´£ There's a lot that goes in to it. What you could do as a business owner is focus on getting reviews.

The spam callers give the search engine marketing space a bad rap. What a professional should be able to do for you is create an optimized site that tells the Google bots what your business is all about.

This is done through on-page optimization, conversion rate optimization and schema.

Then afterwards there's link building, citations and some CTR which is bots engaging with your profile in a realistic manner until the real users come in and replace it.

I would do a scan of your profile to see where you are positioned and work from there.

If you have employees, get them to use Google Maps to type in the business name and drive using the navigation. That will send signals to Google and show you higher if done on a larger scale.",2025-01-13 10:34:26

The advice I‚Äôve picked up here has shaped my business (I run an SEO agency) in ways I never expected. So today, I just want to give back and share what‚Äôs been working for us to grow lately.

Hopefully, some of this sparks ideas for your own business - or at least gives you a fresh perspective!

As we step into 2025, I‚Äôve been thinking about how much this group has helped me on my entrepreneurial journey. The advice I‚Äôve picked up here has shaped my business (I run an SEO agency) in ways I never expected. So today, I just want to give back and share what‚Äôs been working for us to grow lately.

Hopefully, some of this sparks ideas for your own business - or at least gives you a fresh perspective!

**1. Transparency from the start**

We make it a point to be super clear with potential clients. We explain exactly what we‚Äôll do, why it matters, and how it could help their business. No fluff, no hiding the process.

**Example**: One client had been burned by SEO agencies in the past and was understandably hesitant. We showed them our detailed roadmap, broke down each step, and shared how targeting specific low-competition keywords could improve their traffic. They felt reassured and signed on with confidence.

**2. Pre-step planning: A clear roadmap**

Before asking for a commitment, we give clients a ‚Äúsneak peek‚Äù of what working together would look like.

* We identify their main issues.
* Put together a tailored plan.
* Show them what the investment and potential outcomes might look like.

This way, they know what they‚Äôre signing up for before they commit.

**Example**: A small retailer came to us unsure if SEO was worth it. After walking them through a plan showing how a $6K investment could potentially lead to a 15% increase in online sales, they were sold. Seeing the numbers laid out helped them make a confident decision.

**3. Focusing on long-term relationships**

For us, it‚Äôs not about quick wins or just closing deals - it‚Äôs about creating real, lasting value for clients. We focus on quality and sustainable growth, and that‚Äôs helped build a lot of trust.

**Example**: An e-commerce client initially wanted a quick-fix SEO package. Instead, we suggested a phased approach, starting with foundational fixes and link-building over six months. Now they‚Äôre seeing steady growth and are already asking how we can get even more involved.

**Why I‚Äôm sharing this??**

This group has taught me the value of sharing and learning from others. I wanted to pay it forward by sharing what‚Äôs been working for us. If even one of these ideas helps you out, I‚Äôll feel like I‚Äôve done my part.

I find the key take away would be","easy, valuable",issue,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i0d50i/built_a_microsaas_from_the_ground_up_with_no/,"built a microsaas from the ground up with no coding exp‚Äîmade ‚Ç¨500+ in 6 months, here‚Äôs how üí°","let me give you a peek into the less flashy side of entrepreneurship.

before i dive into it: 

NO.... i‚Äôm not making $10,000 MRR, i‚Äôm not 17, and i definitely don‚Äôt drive a lambo like most posts on this subreddit. 

my results are more realistic and humble for sure...

but what i *do* have is some real, unfiltered realistic lessons from the early days of building something from scratch, lessons that might just save you some pricey mistakes and motivate you in your journey!

so about 6 months ago, i was laid off and literally a week after that, got accepted into buildspace and i started building wizapply . app, a microsaas that helps people match their resume experience and skills to the best jobs to apply to. I spent hours searching for roles to apply to and none seemed to be a good fit so i built a tool that would use AI to find roles where i would be a 80% match with job descriptions.

the idea sounded great in my head, the only problem? i had **zero coding experience**

but i dove in, learned along the way, and managed make ‚Ç¨500 revenue which has started to grow exponentially recently. it‚Äôs been wild, and i wanted to share **all** the lessons i‚Äôve picked up:

üåü **dream big, start small**

you don‚Äôt need to build a full app right away. wizapply's first version was literally just a form. focus on one feature that solves one real problem, and go from there. AI will literally help you solve any problem you encounter on the way

literally nobody cares if your tool is a chatgpt wrapper or a fully custom-coded solution. what matters is that it solves a real problem and delivers value in a simple way. focus less on the tech flex or stack and more on making something people actually want to use. get started simple, and take it from there!

ü§Ø **bad bunny's new album will 10x your productivty**

ok, this is not an actual lesson, but i noticed that playing my favourite songs will actually motivate me to sit down and tackle any task i have in front of me. once you stop the music, you know s\*\*t got intense. (music only stops when i come across a real hard problem and requires 100% of my brain power.)

üí≥ **validation = someone‚Äôs credit card**

forget likes, clicks, or ‚Äúgreat idea!‚Äù comments. the real validation is when someone pays for your product. during early days, I had a reddit post go absolute nuts and got 500+ upvotes and many positve comments on my app, but what really validated the idea, was users purchasing paid plans and thats brings me to my next point‚Ä¶

üí≥ **onetime payments = best way to someone‚Äôs credit card**

make it as easy as possible for someone to pull out their credit card and give your product a shot. onetime payments are often the fastest way to do that. no commitments and most users already have 10+ subscriptions and it seems to be trend that people are moving away from subscriptions and prefer onetime payments or pay per credits instead.

üéØ **just ship it. seriously.**

your first version will probably suck (mine did), but you won‚Äôt learn anything until you launch. most developers i met, feared they would miss their shot if they launched an early version and the truth is you will miss your shot if you dont launch at all. so just launch your first working version (mvp)

üìÜ **launch day is every day**

don‚Äôt get hung up on ‚Äúlaunching‚Äù once. every day is a chance to share your product and learn from the feedback. follow this: launch > get feedback > reiterate > launch

üî• **paid ads aren‚Äôt always the answer**

i burnt ‚Ç¨500 on ads because i wasn‚Äôt targeting my ideal customer persona (icp). figure out who‚Äôs actually using (and paying for) your product before you spend money marketing it. organic growth is your friend early on. think X posts, facebooks/linkedin group posts, reddit posts on subreddits where people have the problem youre solving and youtube also seems to be a great way but requires more effort! I personally might tsart documenting my whole journey on youtube

üì£ **70% marketing, 30% product**

you can build the coolest product ever, but if no one knows about it, it won‚Äôt matter. sure word of mouth is a thing, but you need the wow effect and a first customer to get there. reddit, twitter, programmatic SEO, even random tiktoks‚Äîthey all worked way better than paid ads for me.

üí° **constraints unlock creativity**

no coding exp? no problem. i learned how to code by googling, youtubing, and using AI. limited resources force you to find creative solutions, and that‚Äôs where the magic happens. dont freak out if you dont have the answers to something, take your time and find an answer with the resources you have.

üõ†Ô∏è **entrepreneurial bricolage is life**

not sure how to solve something? figure it out with what you‚Äôve got. i didn‚Äôt know how to build a full platform, but i used tools, templates, and AI to get it done and eventually grew the tool to a much more complex stack. you don‚Äôt need to have all the answers‚Äîjust start solving one problem at a time. get started!

üõ†Ô∏è **do things that don‚Äôt scale**

the first version of wizapply wasn‚Äôt automated. i manually found jobs for users and emailed them AI-generated results. it didn‚Äôt scale, but it helped me learn what people actually wanted and were willing to pay for. From there, i built an automated internal tool before launching it to the public

üó£Ô∏è **talk to your early users**

your first users are pure gold. they‚Äôll tell you what works, what sucks, and what they actually want. i wouldn‚Äôt have improved my tool without their feedback. I figured i also spent many hours buildign features that nobody but me thought would be useful. its great to have a vision, but its best to speak with users to deliver on that vision.

üöÄ **momentum is everything**

consistency compounds. at first, progress is slow, but once you get momentum, things flow. just keep pushing. this hits once you realize the power of actually having momentum

**my biggest takeaway?**

don‚Äôt overthink it. every small step adds up, and the journey itself teaches you so much. i‚Äôve gone from knowing nothing about coding to building something real that helps people‚Äîand i‚Äôve found that i actually love this process.

1. Building the product quickly
2. Getting paid pilot customers (made around $1k revenue)

I broke both of those fears, as it happened swiftly, I had no landing page, when people said yes to my product (B2B). It was a easy pitch because it was friends and people I know already, that didn't happen after that (in B2C).

Now, it's been almost 3 months after that, I haven't made a sale yet.

The biggest fears?

1. What if I launch, and don't get any paid customers.
2. What if I launch, and get a lot of users, and I fail to manage.

I don't want to quit this product, because I don't think I will build anything other than this, mainly the reason is that, I have already failed 25+ times in the past 13 years. It's kind of like my last try into entrepreneurship I can say.

Now, that I know my fears, I am quite paralized without ways to solve those. How to break these fears and push further practically.

One way that I want to start figuring out, is by asking you all here in the community.

This project is my last hope, no matter what, I have to make sure I succeed with it.

All I look for are the systems, and routines that would help me break my fears, and grow steadily and sustainably.

I am looking to grow this product to 1 million users (not customers) by the end of 2026. I have experience growing a community in the past to 10k, but I couldn't scale further.

Please suggest.

Thanks in advance.","Tell us about your customer acquisition strategy. Times of discomfort are times of growth. You just get used it. The more you overcome it the more you become comfortable being uncomfortable. Your tolerance for risk and fear will grow. After years of this you become a hardened individual, walking a higher plain than those who sign the back of the check. The path of the self made main. Sooooo‚Ä¶ what did the pilot teach you? Launch and deal with those problems as they happen. Having no customers you can see and work on what isn‚Äôt working. Having alot of customers to manage seems like a healthy problem lol. Regardless of the problem, if you believe you will fuck up, you will fuck up. If you believe and have confidence and faith without any allowance of doubt, you will be 100% fine 1/ Launching is iterative. Get out of the ‚ÄúGrand Opening‚Äù mindset.
2/ Get paid first. Generally, (in my opinion) if the feature is something that you know will be generally available (GA) then consider building it free (free users get 3-months because the feature isn‚Äôt GA). If the feature is fairly custom you have to bill.
3/ It‚Äôs easy to get into heads-down mode and build. You have to keep knocking on doors to validate the product. Don‚Äôt build anything unless a customer wants it and will pay for it.
4/ Don‚Äôt spend any more money. 
5/ finding individual customers is hard. Can you focus customer efforts on partnerships? 
6/ everyone will tell you your product or feature is great and you should build it, until they have to pay. You can't be sure of anything, you have to adapt to situations and stand up under the pressure. High risk high reward, at a certain point the reward goes exponential while risk stays approximately the same. The biggest loss is dying and if you're not afraid of dying you own the world until you don't What's the product? And test my hype generator to get a confidence boost! http://stayhyped.xyz
Throw your product out to the public to get quick reviews and feedback. Why waste 6 more months to procrastinate the launch and get the same answers. Hire a coach or mentor who has crushed it in your niche! To supplement all your hard work, you might want to use some CBT principles or some crunchy coaching stuff like PQ or Ho‚Äôoponopono. Or go to church and the gym. Currently, I have been connecting with people on X. I connect with people over there, and if they don't have a website, I set up one for them as a demo and ask if they would like to use it.

As of now, 4 people did, but they are still not paid customers and I don't want to charge them as they helped me build certain features quickly and I will probably charge them later after an year or so.

Apart from that, I am planning to start with SEO. That's a good question. I can say that ""I should talk more about product"", I used to do that confidently earlier, but not lately.

Also, it's a easy sell, because it's cheap and everyone that I spoke to always had plans to have their own website.

But, I'm yet to figure out ways to convince people who says they are going to use some of my competitors. Can't agree more on more customers, healthy problem to solve.

Your surroundings did. The media you consume, the people you spend time with, and the spaces you occupy ‚Äî this is the diet that feeds your mind.



Most people blame willpower for their failures, but they're wrong. Your environment shapes everything: your thoughts, actions, and future. Like food for your body, every input matters:

Garbage inputs = garbage outputs.



This is why most attempts at change fail: you can't think your way to a different life while remaining in an environment designed to keep you average. Your friends' beliefs become your ceiling, your workspace affects your productivity, and your social media feed shapes your ambitions.



Nothing that you put into your brain is innocuous ‚Äî everything counts.



In today's attention economy, filtering every input becomes exhausting. I've learned to be selective about the content I consume, anticipating how it will affect my worldview, self-perception, and capacity for action. I've found a more practical solution: consume less overall and actively seek out quality content instead of letting random information find me.

Audit your environment for these 3 key areas:

* Physical space: Does your workspace inspire or drain you?
* Social circle: Do your closest relationships challenge or limit you?
* Information diet: Does your content consumption fuel growth or distraction?



Don't wait for motivation to find you ‚Äî it's a product of your environment, not its source. Change your surroundings first, and your thoughts and actions will follow.

[https://newteeth.carrd.co/](https://newteeth.carrd.co/) Hmm Let's get this! Agreed. Success largely comes down to environment. The people who can master building the right environments are usually the ones who reach their goals. The hard part is you often have to start from scratch, which means going through a period of isolation while finding your new tribe. This is the difficult chapter in which most people give up and retreat to old habits.   
  
You just gotta persevere through this difficult phase and you'll find your people eventually.

Good luck. Great point, curating your digital relationships really starts to lay the right foundations. Appreciate it! What are your recommendations to getting this done? I can share what's worked for me:

  
It starts with self-awareness and identifying the goals I want to achieve & exactly what it's going to take from me to get there. I then construct my environment in such a way that it is basically impossible from me to not achieve those goals.

For fitness goals, this means removing all tempting foods from my house and avoiding going places that might compromise my diet.

The key to environmental design is elimination. Most things in life are distractions, so success just comes down to saying ""no"" more than saying ""yes.""

To meet like-minded people, I go where they most likely turn up. You won't find ambitious entrepreneurs in bars at midnight but I've met lots of cool people at fitness events, workshops, and wellness classes like yoga/meditation.

The truth is, maintaining high standards for relationships means accepting their rarity. If you're pursuing an exceptional life and want to connect with equally exceptional people, you must understand that these relationships will be fewer but more meaningful. Very well said! Working remote since Covid has sort of made me antisocial in a way. I need to force my way back to social settings (though I was never a social butterfly), but need to make an effort! I hear how important networking is and even see it with people who are successful. Any recommendations on someone like myself getting the courage to ‚Äúput myself out there‚Äù ? I'm in the same boat - been fully remote for two years now, and honestly, socializing is something I've had to make a real effort to do.



You've already nailed the most important part with 'courage'. It's needed for anything meaningful in life, but you don't have to make huge leaps right away. Think of it like a muscle. You wouldn't jump straight to heavy weights in the gym, same principle applies here.



Just start with tiny conversations wherever you can - with the barista at your coffee shop, the cashier at the grocery store, or even just saying hi to your neighbor. I've definitely been there - when you haven't talked to people in a while, that muscle feels super weak and social stuff feels really uncomfortable. But I learned to recognize it's just because that muscle's been sleeping for a bit and needs warming up. Once I got back in the groove of talking to people comfortably, I started raising the bar - trying things like group workout classes or hanging out at coworking spaces.



Just remember - all that fear and anxiety? It's just in your head. There aren't really any consequences to chatting with people (within reason, of course).



And you seem like an open-minded, considerate person. One thing that really helped me was reminding myself that people actually enjoy talking to someone who's thoughtful and really listens. Their day might even be better for having met you.



Good luck! Those first steps are always the toughest, but I promise it gets easier. You get better with every interaction. I appreciate the chat! I‚Äôll make an effort this week to make small conversations with strangers and see how it goes!",2025-01-13 06:25:45

[https://www.you","potential, worth, valuable",,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i06owg/selling_a_business/,Selling a business?,"I appreciate any feedback here or ideas on this. 

I am the founder of a few companies within the last 5 years. One of which, I do not have the bandwidth to keep up. It is a peer to peer parking platform where users can rent out space on their property, driveway, yard, or even parking lot to other users who need parking. I believed in the idea, but the amount of marketing, etc to support a two person marketplace is astronomical.

We have a redesigned website with very good SEO, a full web app (around 70 users) where users can list spots, find spots, reserve spots, etc. Our domain value is roughly $1,500. We have an Instagram account with about 7,000 followers, and a few more minor assets. I would like to sell it or have an entrepreneur take it over and run with it for a cost.

Would anyone even be willing to buy this business if it is not constantly producing cash flow? If so, where would I go to do this? It has great assets and social proof but would need some work to get if off the ground. Appreciate the help! ","my friend just went through something similar selling his micro-startup. he was worried about the same thing - having a solid product but not enough bandwidth to make it work

from what he learned through the process (and he literally just sold his startup last week), here's what i can share:

even without consistent cash flow, there's definitely potential value in your platform. you've got some solid assets: a working web app with 70 users (that's actual validation), strong SEO, decent domain value, and 7k instagram followers. these aren't just vanity metrics - they're proof of concept

my friend actually found that platforms like Acquire (where he ended up selling) are pretty good for these types of sales. the key thing he learned was that buyers often care more about the potential and existing infrastructure than current cash flow, especially for marketplace businesses

here's what made his sale work, and might help you: he focused on telling the story of the platform's potential - exactly like you did explaining the peer-to-peer parking concept. he broke down all the assets super clearly like you just did. he was upfront about why he couldn't give it the attention it needed (buyers actually respect this honesty)

based on that article he shared with me, this kind of startup could potentially be valued at around 3x annual revenue, but even without steady revenue, the technical assets, domain, and social following have real value to the right buyer

key thing he mentioned was not to undervalue what you've built. the hardest part of any marketplace business is getting those initial users and building the infrastructure - which you've already done

have you considered listing it on micro-acquisition platforms? that's where most of these types of deals happen now. from what i understand, there are entrepreneurs specifically looking for existing platforms they can scale up What if you brought on a business manager and then sold the company to them? You could operate it like a portfolio company There are lots of places to sell. Off the top of my head, Microns, SideProjectors, CodeThrift, Little Exits, Flippa, Acquirebase, Empireflippers...

I have a newsletter that aggregates SaaS products for sale ‚Äî if you list anywhere, I'll probably cover you. But just in case, feel free to let me know when the listing is live and I'll include it in the newsletter. Wow this was more than I could ask for as response. Thanks so much for taking the time to tell me this. What sites did he have the best of luck with? If there would be a way to ask him questions directly that would be awesome. This sounds very relatable to my situation and I would like to go down this road. Thanks again! The real kicker here? The parking industry is one of those rare beasts that's both traditional and ripe for disruption. You've built something that bridges that gap - that's valuable to the right buyer.  
  
Have you started putting together your pitch deck yet? I'd love to hear how you're planning to position these assets. Remember, you're not just selling a platform - you're selling validated potential, and that's worth something in today's market.  I used Bizzed AI - Find & Buy Your Perfect Business acquire com

Every time I'd find a drop I liked, they'd sell out in seconds. Sitting there, refreshing the page, hoping to get lucky. My friend and I would get hyped for drops, only to watch everything be sold out in the first few seconds. Can't imagine how many times the internet would lag right when I had to checkout items. After that one particularly bad drop where none of us got anything from the drop, I thought to myself: why is this so painful?

After a few misses, that's when I realized the problem wasn't me, it was the PROCESS! Instead of wasting time, I worked on fixing the issue and built a tool to ease things out. I didn't want to overcomplicate it, and to be honest, I didn't know if it'd work at first, but after a few attempts and test runs, it started doing exactly what I wanted‚Äîgetting me through checkouts without stress.

The first time I actually secured a hat using the tool felt like a small miracle. Not only did I get what I wanted, but then I realized I could get more too. I ended up flipping a couple of rare ones, and before I knew it, I'd made my first $1,000. What started as a way to avoid frustration turned into a fun little side hustle. Best part, knowing that I solved a problem that had been a huge headache for me and also my friends.

Anyone else had an idea grow into something bigger than you expected? Let me know‚ÄîI'd love to hear your stories!","You couldn't get a hat because flippers used bots to get them within a few seconds of the drop. So you started botting and flipping.

I feel like you're trying to make this sound like something else when that's the entire summary. You scale it by becoming a flipper and flipping more things You became apart of the problem that you tried to solve.¬†


I guess that's a win so long as numbers go up.¬† The epitome of ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt beat em, join em.‚Äù This is about as entrepreneurial as scalping tickets. Not scalable and you are a drain on society for doing this. r/thathappened Something similar happened with me with blocking ads on a site. 2 years ago, I found out some keyboard trick to skip ads whenever one came up on a site.

After about a week, I decided I wanted to make a program to automatically do it whenever an ad came up. I taught myself how to make Chrome extensions (took a few weeks, I already knew the coding language), and since it only costed $5 to publish, I said why not and did. I didn't expect it to reach anyone since I wasn't spending anything on marketing (still haven't to this day).

I didn't get many users as an extension, and thought, what if I could turn it into a desktop app. That took 3 months. I got a bunch of backlash on that when I posted on some communities here. That also didn't get many users. And then I decided to turn it into what it is now, a mobile app. That took about a month to do. Those first three months as a mobile app it didn't get past 25 downloads. After one post on r/androidapps, I jumped from \~20 to 80 downloads and it slowly added up to where it is now‚Äî4.4 stars, 1 million downloads, 650k active users, and 191 countries reached.

I‚Äôm 27, and have worked for the same company since I was 15, but plan to leave to pursue entrepreneurship. This was always a thought I have had in the back of my mind, but the company I am working for is being bought out in a few months and I figured this is a better time than any since I assume there will be layoffs/other not great things happening in the brand. 

My question is this ‚Äî Would you leave if you were me? And what industries would you recommend looking into for entrepreneurship for someone in corporate restaurant management, who advises, and oversees operations and development for over $100,000,000 worth of business? I‚Äôm no stranger to work. 80 hour weeks, and no weekends and holidays have been my norm for most of my adult life. I want something that is mine, and that I have control over, and I can eventually scale. 

My current situation for finances are as follows:

-$225k per year currently
-$100k in liquid capital to use
-820 credit (assuming needing to borrow SBA)

Thank you in advance to anyone willing to read, and advise in any way. ","Interesting that a lot of people are discouraging you to go for it because of the salary - I say keep the job but build this thing on the side but you‚Äôll then need to determine what‚Äôs the number you need to be making a month to make the Jump Stay in your cushy gig. Be frugal and invest . You‚Äôll be a multi millionaire very soon . you make a huge amount of money at 27. im a little concerned youve only save 100k to be honest? but you really should not quit. keep your job if youcan, or if you get fired find a new job .THEN try starting your own business on the side. If it ever does 6 figures then maybe 'consider' quitting. But most people who start their own business fail. $100k isnt much runway for anything. Game plan:

* Keep your job.
* Reduce expenses.
* Save 1 to 2 years of living costs.
* Use your current job stability to start a business on the side.
* If it fails, you've still got your job and you can try again.
* If it succeeds, you've built a platform to jump onto after quitting your job.
* (You haven't mentioned any business ideas, so we don't have the context to know if the idea is tested.)
* Then, as you say, with the buyout often comes layoffs.
* So keep your job for as long as it lasts. Nope. Keep your job and work on your business projects on the side. It typically takes years for people to earn decent profits on their business and most new business fail to become profitable. I was making 200k at my gig and left to start a company. I'd tell you to only quit and start your own thing if you feel like you ***have to*** start a company. What are you doing to make that much at 27 You have an excellent paying job. Maybe consider doing your business idea on the side first. Keep your job while working 2-3 per day building your future. Get revenue to support your life, then quit your job.
Quitting prematurely is not the best idea Im going to give you a bit of a contrarian advice: you should do it. Most folks here are seeing the 200k role and are in FEAR of you losing it. But guys like you rarely lose really ‚Äî your work ethic, skills and knowledge got you here. You weren‚Äôt ‚Äúlucky‚Äù.

BUT (this is a big but) you need to ask yourself this: are you leaning towards entrepreneurship because there is a problem out there you believe you are uniquely qualified to solve? Or you doing this to mitigate against this pending layoffs. If the answer is the latter, then You are acting based of FEAR and that is never good. 

The drive to build something you can proud off should be more than the drive of mitigating against a layoff. Because if this entrepreneurial thing doesn‚Äôt work out, at least it was something you deeply felt that needed to be done. That should be your driving force. If not, stay at your job my guy. The big question is, can you find another job in that pay range? If so, how long can you wait? If you decide to leave, how long can you really take to pursue your venture? Do you have a plan in mind? If you do, what happens if it doesn't go to plan? 

So many things to think about. That's a good chunk of change and I assume there's a mortgage tied to that.

I hope you are in a good place to make the decision. I'd take the job, but I'm old now and it typically pays better in the long run.

Best wishes. I coach entrepreneurs in business operations and process building.  No successful entrepreneur I‚Äôve ever worked with asked if they should start their own thing.  They put aside the fear, the hesitation, and paralysis and they took action.  Saying you want something of your own and doing what it takes to get it are 2 very different things.  My advice to you, if you truly want to make it as a business builder get the fuck off reddit and get to work. I read somewhere Jeff Bezos was making very good salary when he wanted to quit and start Amazon and his then boss thought he was crazy to leave and start Amazon. The boss gave him time to rethink his decision and boom! Look where he‚Äôs at today. 

Dont allow your current situation good or bad (in your case great salary) hinder your advancement. 

I say give it a shot! You regret the things you never start. Start a consulting business doing what you already do.

Get your current company to be your first client and sign a year contract before the acquisition. You'll train your replacement and ensure a smooth transition for new management. 

Network and add a client or two. Target 20 hrs a week (tops) in supporting these clients while generating enough cash to cover all expenses plus. 

Use this as an experience builder for the marketing/sales skills you'll need. Once that's hitting revenue and time targets, target the same industry/clients with some problem you can solve that's potentially scalable.

Just one idea. No right answers! You don't even have an idea of what to do it seems.¬†


You work what? 40/50/60/70 hours a week right now?¬†


Use the rest of your time and even down time at work thinking what you would actually do.¬†


You are ahead in the game and it makes little sense to throw away your lead.


Why exactly would you have to quit? What exactly is going to take up all your time?¬† Well. You are asking the question of $225K/year Vs Tons of unknown(You are starting at $0 to $infinite, the time it takes and certainty is the question).

Real lessons:  
1. if you start a business 1st time, you will fail - Be prepared To handle it.  
2. It takes at least 4-6 times before you will find a win. 

Entrepreneurship is ‚Äúwholesome journey. You can only realize it when you live it.  
  
You are the BEST to answer your question.  
  
If you are prepared take a plunge. Good luck. keep the job. Save up a million bucks then see what you want to do. Find a profitable business for sale in your area if you really want to do it. A business people will always need.. healthcare, automotive, towing... service based. 

Also do not leave your job,  you can work on the business on the side until you're confident enough in the income to quit. 

If they lay you off I'm assuming the severance package after 12 years and your current salary will be pretty good. Don't lose that by quitting. Trust me don‚Äôt leave your job. 

In entrepreneurship you will fail a lot and you don‚Äôt want to lose that stable income. It more stressful relying fully on your business venture then just doing a job and a side business. 

I‚Äôm similar to you and in my 20s with a 6 figure job. I already did business without a job and it too stressful just relying on a non guaranteed income. I think it good growing it on the side because I‚Äôm still able to get alot of work done and can outsource some of the tasks to take some of the workload off me. Good luck Millionaire first, you will be much more comfortable with failing and restarting I made the decision to try entrepreneurship at the same age and with a higher income and don't regret it. However you should definitely consider what happens if entrepreneurship doesn't work out for you. I was working in tech and pretty confident that I could find employment again at the same or better income as when I left.

Since you say you're in corporate restaurant management, and since I know nothing about that, I'd ask yourself how easy it would be to get back into the field at a similarish income if you left. Making this much is very normal in tech even in your twenties but I suspect your situation is a bit abnormal for your industry and relative years of experience (but I could be wrong).

Also, if you have strong reason to believe that layoffs are coming up and that's a primary motivation for you to leave, definitely rethink that! If you stay until you get laid off you'll be able to collect unemployment and possibly get a severance (which in some cases are quite large). If it's more because the vibes are bad and you don't have strong reason to believe you'll be laid off then I get it though, I did the same thing.

\> what industries would you recommend looking into for entrepreneurship for someone in corporate restaurant management, who advises, and oversees operations and development for over $100,000,000 worth of business?

I feel like you shouldn't have to ask strangers about this if you're about to start a company tbh (it should be obvious) but probably a restaurant (or franchise, etc) or something that has restaurants as customers, to address a problem or fill an unmet need/demand you've noticed based on your experience. Same age as you, but I teach. Go as long as you can; after, you‚Äôll have plenty of headway to pursue your project. I'm going to give you the same advice as everyone else who asks this question. 

Know your goals. 

What do you want from life? Then work backwards. 

Keep going backwards until you know the very next step from where you are right now. 

For myself for example, all I want is freedom measured by my ability to travel - whenever, wherever, however long and in business class. That's it. I don't care about being a C-Suite exec in a multi-billion dollar company or owning five houses or luxury vehicles.

I then went backwards and figured out what would get me to that position. I settled on starting a business and continued working backwards. Now, everyday I wake up knowing exactly what the next step is for myself and how those steps fit into the larger picture. Rule 1) never ever quit your job to start up unless you have cash flow, contacts, or investors. 

Like most, you‚Äôll be crying if you do. 1. First off, congratulations on achieving so much at such a young age‚Äîwhat an incredible accomplishment!

2. Second, trust yourself. You don‚Äôt reach this level at your age without having the skills, drive, and mindset needed for success.

3. Third, take a moment to evaluate how burned out you feel. If you‚Äôre on the brink of exhaustion, give yourself permission to take a break‚Äîyou‚Äôve earned it.

4. However, if you feel you can push through for one more year, use that time to create and execute a solid business plan.

Be mindful of where you seek advice. Many people offer traditional, risk-averse perspectives that might sound wise but won‚Äôt necessarily align with your goals. Success often requires smart, calculated risks‚Äîyes, risks. But also remember, no amount of financial security is worth sacrificing your well-being.

Good luck‚Äîyou‚Äôve got this! I mean‚Ä¶if you have to ask you‚Äôre NGMI You're thinking on suicide. Believe me. Could you get back in if you needed to once you‚Äôre out of runway? Have a solid plan in place before leaving. Like super solid. That means guaranteed customers in the pipe for your new business. 

Savings, debt, venture capital is not a solid plan. That money will run out. I would keep juicing the 225k salary, that‚Äôs awesome congrats.

When the company gets sold, will there be a key employee retention plan or a bonus structure for you staying on? At such a high salary, I would imagine you have some worth to the company and wouldn‚Äôt necessarily get cut (Or maybe I‚Äôm ignorant and they won‚Äôt need you after it goes through?)? With all your expertise and experience what is something that you can provide a value to businesses who would buy your service or idea or product? 

I mean are you looking to open a franchise? With your experience alone that would be a great idea if you can get in on one 

But if you're looking to be some type of consultant or provide a solution for people in the industry you work in, what would that be? I fail to see the plan here. A plan in my honest and humble opinion would be to at least make a substantial amount of revenue per month for 3 months in your business while continuing to work full time before going either part time at your job or quitting entirely.

I didn‚Äôt leave my $150k a year job until I was confident that I was pulling $20k in revenue a month on my side hustle. Most businesses fail so at least figure out what‚Äôs working (or has a really high chance), otherwise you‚Äôre just going to be buying yourself another job (especially if you‚Äôre considering a traditional business or franchise) that may make less money with way more work and risk.

Just my 2 cents. You have a great thing going for you right now, you really just need to make sure you have a better thing going on the side. nope. It would seem like a good idea in your mind I get it, however it is too risky. If you were making 20-30k and had some experience and a very very thought out plan then I would say go for it. If it were me, my first step would be to cut my cost of living as much as possible. If you are not driving an old beater, sell what you are driving and buy one.

Look at all your other outgoings and eliminate all that you can.

Then work out how much you actually need to live on. You want to have that amount, times 3 years, in the bank, before you quit your job.

Then start the business on nights and weekends. There are a whole lot of hoops that you have to jump through when setting up your business that cost money, and take time, but earn no money. Getting registered as a business, building your website, all the rest. You can do all of this while you keep your job.

You are far more likely to succeed, and far less likely to make bad decisions, if you aren't desperate. No you don‚Äôt leave to pursue a random business of which you have no clue what you even want to do. How about researching industries .. ideas. Get a business plan going first and know what you‚Äôre actually going for , before leaving your job. You leave only when your business has started to make you more money than your main job. Sent you a dm, plz check once you get time. I‚Äôm in the same boat minus a buck on the salary and I work much less. Paralysis by analysis has been my biggest problem I believe. Conversations I‚Äôve had with current and former entrepreneurs that have had successful exit(s) recommended staying with the W2 until surpassing W2 gross + insurance costs to be on the safe side. If I ever pull the trigger on starting something I will be at my W2 until I feel that its affecting my work quality. Good luck! I'm no expert, but if I were you, I would first start something as a side hustle.
In my case, I'm doing e-commerce / agency and stuff, so that's possible to do as a side hustle/ part-time after your job.
But if you are trying to do something offline, then i doubt you might not have time with your job.
I would like to suggest something online which you can do with the internet as a side hustle, those things can scale to the moon easily imo without quitting your job in the first place.

Lmk if you have any questions i would love to help. Best of luck! Find a problem that you can solve and sell. Until then it's a moot point, keep working but figure out what problem you're best suited at fixing. 

Like others have said, keep your day job but start it as a side hustle to validate. I‚Äôm not sure if this has already been mentioned, but everyone that I know who has been laid after a merger gets a nice severance. That said, I think it would be wise to stick it out and see what happens, on top of that whatever business you want to start may not be successful so it is better to proof your startup idea before leaving your current role No, but start projects on the side with like minded individuals. Fail a couple projects, maybe one will work. Don't quit still, make a couple projects works, then you'll know you can make it in entrepreneurship. You make a quarter mil at 27 and you want to quit your job? What? 1) you don't know exactly what you wanna pursue
2) you think quitting the job will somehow enlighten you

Verdict: Absolutely no. 

I forbid you from quitting. Can we trade jobs? I would look into buying an existing small business. A lot of times they just need to be modernized. [removed] Don‚Äôt, unless fired. Keep in mind, It will be extremely unlikely with that capital that you‚Äôll ever make as much. Stay until you have a plan for a product/service that you have throughly vetted, discussed with a few others and decide this is the way to go and things also the right time. If you get laid off that just gives you more time U should do both until ur buisness makes the kind of money u can live on.u gotta work out the mistakes and curves first Homie... your 27... your making $225k... do not change a Damm thing... ride that for another 10 years.. invest your income... if you still want to pursue entrepreneurship 10 years from now, go for it! Source - a 27 year old not making $225k / yr currently pursuing entrepreneurship..... I agree with some of the others. Do both until the side job becomes the main job. Make the main pay for the side hustle while you figure things out. There are always ups and down when starting anything new... No matter your expertise. Get the new thing started and stood up then leave when you want... Or ask for more money knowing that if they say no you have the backup. It's gonna be hard though, but you said you're no stranger to work. Plan for it, don't do it until you got laid off. If you don‚Äôt mind my asking, what is your position and what line of work are you in? P[eople who maintain their job while starting their own business have a 33% reduced chance of business failure.](https://msbfile03.usc.edu/digitalmeasures/joe.raffiee/intellcont/Raffiee_Feng_2014_AMJ-1.pdf) So start now and still milk the salary. If you need to ask other people then, no. The answer is always leave, IF you can grind. Doing what exactly There is no greater feeling in the world than a Successful start up. However, team no sleep and stress me may tell you otherwise. I would recommend working closely with a consultant who can evaluate your goals and needs and propose the best business opportunity. 
I‚Äôm a franchise consultant and everyday I work with clients who are doing the very same thing you‚Äôre planning. There are many fantastic businesses looking to grow with experienced businesspersons like yourself. 
There are thousands of franchise businesses but I only work with 200+ select vetted brands. I‚Äôd be happy to speak with you more. Don't just start a business.  Start one you know about.   Where you know what you are doing.  Maybe related to current work.  It's easier to start a side hustle while still working.  Otherwise, you are jumping off a cliff. From context you have provided, I can see some resemblance of myself. You are 10 years younger than me but make more in salary, I probably work significantly less than you which allowed me to invest my time in a number of businesses. With that experience, my advice echoes many comments here, you probably should not quit and should milk and ride it out. However, I do commend you for being proactive and seeing if your situation is not sustainable. I think that is going unnoticed but there are other options instead of jumping into a dry option. Like others have said, consulting is a great option if you just build a website on your short available time off, find a hobby or passion project where you can turn it into a SaaS and build that as well. No My most successful company was built while I was working and stable. Once business picked up and we were busy, I left my job. 

By doing both, you can really set yourself and your business solid.  I wouldn't quit. You don't even know what industries are profitable. No. Do it.  You won't regret it. No No Live a life without regrets I would keep the job / switch if lid off.. Invest money and get ur ideas built by someone.. You be the consultant/ owner.

But, it would demand lot of ur time.. and people don‚Äôt put in as much effort to build your ideas as the owner. Others have said it. Be strategic, make a 3-5 year plan to hit your goals, then make those happen. Yeah probably not. I mean, maybe but 10 years of working for yourself is likely not going to get you 2.25m in income where you‚Äôre on that track today, plus whatever raises and bonuses you pickup along the way. I say this as someone who it worked out for, sold a company for $42.5m in 2015‚Ä¶i got lucky. One of the first reasons why people don't pursue their entrepreneur dream is ""leaving their salary"" for the uncertain. 
If you really want to do it, do it. Don't wait, do that step.
Put yourself in the condition that ""you need to figure it out"". Do both There have been many who have left their stable career jobs to pursue a new venture. If it tugs at you everyday maybe it‚Äôs something you should uncover. Brother If your making that much, look into accredited investing, your close enough to where of you wanted to you could pursue it, I believe in you. Yes. What have you done towards your business?  Do you already have a side business?  How will you support yourself.  

Leaving a paying job for a dream sounds sexy but it‚Äôs pretty dumb if you haven‚Äôt event taken the first steps to getting your business started What do u do ? I would say absolutely the freedom of time and soul even if you don't make as much is so totally worth it Don‚Äôt leave your job. There are sites where you can hire assistants from Philippines. Getshepherd is a good place to start. Married? Any kids? Or want to get married and have kids soon? Then no. 

If single at 27, go for it. Worst can happen is you‚Äôll recover from the fail by the time you are 30 and learn a ton and go back to paycheck. Get it out of your system while you‚Äôre young. If you decide to go for it, I hope you succeed and retire by 40. Nah, build on the side until it has enough revenue. I mean‚Ä¶. You leave your high paying job for entrepreneurship when you have an idea for a business. Really, you should wait until you actually *have* a business before quitting. 

Take your time to brainstorm and come up with a business plan. See how much time you can devote to it while working your ‚Äú9 to 5.‚Äù Quit when you‚Äôre ready to pursue it and it has at lease some probability of being financially viable. Are you thinking of going for it because of a genuine love for the game of business or as a career move? Its not a job switch and it will suck immensely. If you're willing to go broke for the love of entrepreneurship then you'll probably succeed. If you're hoping for a clear shot from a very stable situation to a better one keep your job. How does a 27 yo make 225k? I was only making $100K with a family of 4 in my mid-30s, but I had $2000 in the bank, so I went all-in on entrepreneurship. 

I've had a business for 10 years and built a company where my take-home is more than the salary I had. Plus, the business covers some expenses, so I don't have to pay as much. Lastly, I come and go as I please; nobody tells me what to do, and I get to learn a lot from Millionaires and Billionaires who are overwhelmingly helpful in sharing their knowledge to help me grow.

I could make more going back to work for somebody as I'm a software engineer, but I'm in it for the long game and for the ability to provide my family with wealth, no matter how long it takes.

Entrepreneurship isn't easy. You will work more hours than anything you've ever done before. However, it is gratifying. Since you‚Äôre already an expert in the industry, it would be a good move for you to open up your own restaurant/ food franchise. Lots of money in the industry if you manage and market well. If your first restaurant succeeds, it becomes very easy to expand and open more in other locations. 225k a year .? You have no idea how lucky and fortunate you are. I wouldn‚Äôt quit unless I had an entrepreneurial pursuit in mind‚Ä¶and I‚Äôd probably get the ball rolling whilst still employed. That‚Äôs how I started in my twenties‚Ä¶ Entrepreneur here. Absolutely not. You are winning. There is plenty of time for you to be one later in life. If you are making this kind of money now, you should be slamming all kinds of money into your investment portfolio and get your life completely funded before making a move. You'll regret leaving if you do.

My entrepreneurship cost me close to 1.5 million in pay in a career I liked over 10 years. Yes, I had success as an entrepreneur, but honestly, I would have had a higher quality of personal life with way more free time if I had stayed employed and funded retirement.

Instead of the $3.5m NW, I'd likely be at $6-7m now and fully checked out.

YMMV. Good luck. I kept the high salary gig and bootstrapped my company. I wasn‚Äôt able to grow nearly as fast as needed and others picked up my model and beat me with it for a while.  If you can build out your business plan and get someone else to fund it, then go all in.  I know a few people that used their personal credit to start their company and have had to file bankruptcy - use caution. Acquire an already existing business from a Boomer who‚Äôs ready to hang their hat. SBA loan will get you about 90% there, so 100K could get you about a 1 Mil business. I‚Äôd suggest saving or selling other assets to raise a bit more than that tho. Lotta literature, podcasts, university courses to learn more information about entrepreneurship through acquisition. How the fuck is no one asking the real questions like what the hell kind of job did you start at 15 and still have at 27 that pays that amount? ""Should i get rid of my toilet and start shitting in a catbox?"" I‚Äôd do both if I were you. From my own experience and from others I‚Äôve seen. It‚Äôs good to have a steady income until your business as an entrepreneur is bringing in enough steadily to support your bills, savings, and emergency money. 

Entrepreneurship is wonderful and very fulfilling. Grueling but well worth the sacrifices you‚Äôll have to make. 

A good move for you would be to open your own consulting firm in the industry you‚Äôre in; given your background. Plenty of people need to be told what to do. And you can branch into other industries as well just by reading and studying them. 

Focus on one thing, build that out. You could also not start from scratch and purchase a business from someone who is profitable and wants to sell. Then you do what you need to increase the businesses revenue. 

Look into Mergers and Acquisitions; and Private Equity. 12 years working in your company? If you get laid off, you might get a hefty severance since often you get up to 1 month severance per year of service (depends on jurisdiction) No. Not until what you plan on doing makes that salary and more. Get an idea, test it (read ‚ÄûMom test‚Äú) if it works, scale up. If that's all real good for you but that post sounds more like you are still 15. I'd say dream on. Go for it. If you want a business you should do it now. You aren't getting any younger and you will likely never have more energy than you do now. Starting a business is all consuming and it helps to have the vigor of youth. It will only be more difficult as you get older and further away from entrepreneurship. Working a job you can do when your older, starting a business is hard. 

The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the second best time is today. Always go for it , fuck the money . With the right time , energy and focus you can net that in a few years and own the very asset that pays you. 

Use every god given minute to build your business while working until you make enough money to leave and continue. So the fact you have no starting direction means you aren't ready. You may be ready to start exploring, but sure as shit not ready to dump the job. 

You need to find something you are knowledgeable about, but also passionate. No one will care more about your business than you so you need to be 100%.

Look into opening your own consulting firm if you are any good at what you do now and enjoy it. If you have some good friends at work, see what they are open to. Start building on the side. Maybe try to cut back on hours at work to build more and then leave once you have some type of traction to fall back on. 

225k are golden handcuffs, i‚Äôd have a hard time leaving also but a dream is a dream. Keep the job Not sure if the restaurant business is sincerely on the up and up. 

I would explore as a side gig and see if you like it first. Do not leave your job, as it serves as your support system. I actually wrote about this in my book [Business as a Baby](https://linktr.ee/chumze) and shared it in a recent post about getting support from my brother. Remember, when you start a business, it‚Äôs like a newborn baby. Your regular job acts as a support system for the business until it can survive and cover your fundamental expenses.

Think about it this way: if you have a newborn, you take parental leave to care for the baby while still getting paid from your job. You wouldn‚Äôt quit your job to care for your baby, right? The same applies to your business in its early stages. If you expect a baby business to take care of you too soon, it will put unnecessary pressure on both you and the business.

I‚Äôd love to send you an advanced reader copy of my book so you can read it before making a decision. I made the exact same mistake with my first business, and I hope my experience can help you avoid it. I love reddit, but this is something I'd speak to a good business coach about What do you do for work? Quite a high salary for some being 27. Great job mate. First validate your offering before leaving stable income. What problem are you solving? Once the market validates you, test, validate and generate sales and then scale and focus on whichever is showing a better metric I don't think you have enough liquid.

Do you have 2 to 3 years living expenses? Big salary at a great age, what is your monthly nut? What could you REALISTICALLY cut it to?

This all factors in. 

If you're not sure what you absolutely want to do, keep stacking, do not rush. Stay see if they offer you good money to leave Not sure about this. Entrepreneurship is something you are driven to do because you have to scratch the itch, there‚Äôs a problem that needs solving and it‚Äôs driving you crazy that no one is solving it so you do it. 

So you‚Äôll know when the time is right. 

Great idea to start preparing now - save some money, learn, maybe build a couple of things on the side. No Maybe work with a financial advisor ... Build a bit of an investment portfolio and grow the 100k ... Then pursue the entrepreneur route knowing you have something to fall on and emergency funds. 
Unless you manage to hit it good off your first month in operation. If you're starting your own business you'll probably have to carry it for atleast 3 months ... While you build your place in the market... Depending what industry etc. This is an absolutely perfect scenario to use as a launchpad for your own venture. 

Whatever you do, don‚Äôt quit yet. 

Use this transitional period to allow your aspirations to marinate.

‚Ä¶what do you want to do?
‚Ä¶which contacts in do you have in your current job that might be useful?
‚Ä¶do the current clients have potential?

You‚Äôre in your current job with the invincibility cheat activated. 

Chances are, you‚Äôll get laid off with a healthy settlement and maybe some gardening leave that allows you to roll out your venture with close to zero financial risk

Worse case, spend a few months doing a shitty job while your main focus is your new venture and then get laid off. 

It‚Äôs a complete free roll. **Should You Leave for Entrepreneurship? A Strategic Perspective""**

You‚Äôre in a great position to pursue entrepreneurship: young, experienced, and financially stable. With $100K liquid capital, an 820 credit score, and a strong operations background, this could be the perfect time to transition, especially with your company‚Äôs buyout creating uncertainty.

# Industries to Explore

1. **Ghost Kitchens:** Capitalize on food delivery growth with scalable multi-brand kitchens.
2. **Franchising:** Leverage your restaurant expertise to run profitable franchise locations.
3. **Consulting:** Offer operations consulting for small businesses, scaling into a team model.
4. **Renewable Energy:** Invest in small-scale solar or battery projects for long-term growth.

# How to Start

* Validate the market with small, cash-flow-positive projects.
* Secure SBA loans early to preserve your capital.
* Focus on scalable systems to transition from operator to owner over time.

Leaving a $225K job is a big step, but your skills in scaling operations and managing $100M+ businesses give you an edge. Think strategically, start lean, and build for scalability. Success comes from calculated risks, not leaps of faith.

Good luck‚Äîthis could be the start of something big! Read The Millionaire Fastlane. It will give you reasons to start a company and it will give you tools to not fuck it up (like most do). 

I've seen dozens of millionaires created by this book.

FYI: we did a test, and the average count of failed businesses to start a successful company was 8. Those who were asked were millionaires.

Also. Don't take loans up until you have at least 10k/mo profit. I think go for it; at 27 you have a lot of options and you can be very risk prone. It's the best time to take the leap ;) Before you make the leap, it‚Äôs crucial to understand that raising capital is often a necessary skill for most entrepreneurial ventures. Even if you have $100K in liquid capital, that won‚Äôt go far if you‚Äôre aiming to build something scalable. Depending on the type of business you pursue, chances are you‚Äôll need outside funding to grow effectively. Raising money isn‚Äôt just about getting cash; it‚Äôs about bringing in partners who believe in your vision and can help amplify your efforts.

I‚Äôve been in your shoes, stepping out on my own, and I can tell you it‚Äôs one of the most rewarding paths you can take. But it‚Äôs also a demanding one, especially financially at first, then it becomes a money machine. If you do it right, it can open doors you never thought possible. The key is to focus on learning the fundraising process‚Äîhow to pitch, connect with investors, and structure deals that support your goals. That knowledge will help you avoid financial strain and set you up for long-term success. Take the time to build a solid plan and understand how to get the money you‚Äôll need to scale. It‚Äôs hard work, but it‚Äôs worth it. Nooooooooo Do it, and you will never look at your salary again. Purpose > money. Imagine entrepreneurship doesn‚Äôt work for you? Do your regular job then pursue that on the side. Think smart Keep the job, build on the side. No I would keep your job until you've got enough money to retire for life and then build enough money to pursue entrepreneur with only that amount you've built up. Don't touch your retirement money at all. It's up to you if you want to risk but that's the safe way I would do hit that's just me. What works and doesn't work is different for everybody. work for 2-3 more years , you will have more money and if decision is still the same. you can do it even global  economic will be a lot better from now.


take risk and reward but pursue what your ambition is, better than safee route as robot working. cheer That is fairly disturbing how easily people come up with life advice as if they are playing RPG game 

I assume if you have such a well paid job you probably have enough capacity to decide for yourself 

P.S. Entrepreneurship is a very broad term and you can literally start with 1% of your annual salary if you want to My suggestion. Wait for it to be bought out, find a way to keep your job but lower the amount of tasks required of you. 

I've had a situation similar to this where there was a change in management and the last manager was oblivious on what I did and the new manager was way more competent. They ended up taking up a good part of my job and I was more or less advising and managing people. I was technically still working but I was free pursue my own stuff on the side. I was willing to make it work until the CEO decided to be a d\*ck and actually stupid trying to go for a different direction that was not working. It was a sinking ship. 

I already had clients when I left but I just start focusing 100% on my own stuff.

Unless your posting at your current company is leading to major bottlenecks to your own company's growth, you'll most likely take a while to actually launch it properly because there's a lot of documentation, legal stuff and busy work aside from just growing your client base when launching a company by yourself. The salary is what we call golden handcuffs. You‚Äôre at the age where it‚Äôs not too late to still have the energy to take the leap into entrepreneurship and charge into the unknown. (Speaking from experience at 28) 

I‚Äôd make sure you start whatever it is on the side and prove the concept first. 

Restaurants and food are a very hard industry regardless of where you are at in the food chain and / or corporate office. 

Build relationships with others in the industry so you go in eyes wide open and potentially have strategic partners and mentors to guide you as obstacles arise. Being an owner your role is to solve problems. I‚Äôm a (Software & Service) Product Designer and have designed many hospitality projects (itsu, jollie bee, GBK); food ordering apps, and staff ordering (on Square terminals) If you have a Product or service in mind send me a DM. I‚Äôd suggest looking into what you can do, sticking to the job until you know that your product/service will succeed (before leaving job) Would not leave your job of $225k/year. Restaurants are dumpster fires in this economy and have been extremely difficult since Covid. Wait until the buy-out, there might be some perks there that will leave you with more money than just resigning outright. In the meantime, use that work ethic to soft-launch your business and get things going. Yes you should teach what you know. I would teach how to run a food business. you can create courses on operations and whatnot. it is better to keep the job and start the side business, but layoffs are layoffs. whatever business you start, I would be realistic and expect about a year before it starts to show any return on your investment. yes. I also agree with the rest, build it on the side, then delegate the small tasks by hiring a couple of people part time. Maybe, in the beginning you would be needing like 2-3 hours daily (i know hard with the 80 weekly hours). When you see atleast what you are building is make you some cash and could be scalable then jump, until then, makes no sense that you jump because you cant put 12-15 hours weekly.

Your job is what'll give you the breathing room to try new marketing campaigns, sales and sustainably hiring and paying people for certain tasks. Not the most comfortable solution i know, but life is hard. You are probably one of the very rare few I‚Äôd recommend ‚Äúyes‚Äù, but stay in your wheelhouse (restaurants). I‚Äôd normally never recommend someone with your salary to open a SMB, especially a restaurant.  But you, with your qualifications and experience are the rare exception. 

On caveat, get investors, not the SBA. You are way undercapitalized and the SBA sucks. With your experience and network you shouldn‚Äôt have a hard time finding investors. Before doing entrepreneurship  look into being an investor No See if you can find a Franchise to buy out. Do some owner financing and get in cheaply and start improving. Got to be a Boomer or Gen X who is ready to step away and keep some steady income for a few years as you increase sales and profits and pay them off. See if you can find a Franchise to buy out.

I advise you to save up some money then quit and if you can, start a side hustle to pursue entrepreneurship. Another thing is are you really passionate about this? If you are, go for it. If you just started wanting to become an entrepreneur, try it out but don't quit. Because there's a high chance that you end up not liking entrepreneurship, and not getting a lot of money.

That's my advice. It depends on how much free time you have. I advise you to save up some money then quit and if you can, start a side hustle to pursue entrepreneurship.

That's my advice. Nearly the same situation last year, pay, assets and credit haha! I have 15 employees and we did 4.1m in 2024. DM if you want to set up a coffee chat or if you want any help. Just do it, best decision ever. Stay employed, but stop working hard.

Cut your lifestyle expenses to the minimum.

Start building something on the side. Start networking.

When new management comes in, things will change.

Take the severance if possible.

Then pursue entrepreneurship full time. Quit your job. I build my side business while having my full time job. I also recently made the decision of leaving my full time job to dedicate to my business. Everyone talks about how you can build it on the side but going all in at the beginning is the only way you can focus and push yourself to grow your business the way you want it. It wont grow otherwise. If you are sure that you can manage your finances until your business grows, you can leave your job. But ensure that you are passionate about starting something and growing it. Since you have the experience in business operations, you can start with same. Depends You‚Äôre the best person to figure out what type of business you should start.  Look for a problem in your industry that your business can solve.  Once you have that figured out - go for it.   You may make mistakes along the way but treat them as lessons. Yes, if you want to make more money I walked away from a $200k+ job to start my own business as a consultant. I say do it. You will have a lot more control and a lot more earning potential. That said, my goals were time and freedom, not maximizing income. My job was also affecting my health, so there is that, too. Keep the job, build on the side and weekends, and get the skills along the way. Take a week vacation and pretend you're doing your business full time during that week - what would you do? Who do you call to sell? What are you marketing? What skills/help do you need? Worst case, by the end of the week, you realize the unstructured/unclear path forward isn't for you. Best case, you realize you love it, have a market/customer segment/idea you are passionate about and realize what skills you need to make that happen. 

  
Keep the job and work on this on the side. Consistently working 2 hours a day over 6 months will move the needle a lot. If you think the end is nigh, just ride it out for a bit. Live as cheaply as possible and start stacking as much capital/investments as possible. Take the time to assess what money you actually need to live vs. what you've been spending. It‚Äôs very hard to take a side gig seriously and grow it while working a full time job. Especially if that full time job demands brainpower. 

I would keep the full time job until you‚Äôve developed a basic business plan, try to talk to potential customers to refine that plan, and then drop the full time job and shoot your shot. 

$100k is a lot of money to start a relatively capital-light business. Service business supporting restaurants might be good. Again, id recommend open ended interviews with potential customers to just find out what problems they face. Build the business plan around that. 

Good luck! Entrepreneurship is a trip! Until you have a clear idea what you want to do, don‚Äôt leave your job. You‚Äôre still way young and in a very unique/lucky situation so tread a bit carefully and do a lot of research, talk to people, pick brains, see what ideas and businesses resonate and realize you‚Äôre new to approaching your own business. It‚Äôs a different world. Honestly probably best to buy something but to get real experience you have runway to explore and fail to learn a bit on your own. Buying Revenue is easier then creating it buy something with systems in place and that‚Äôs cash flowing.In the words of Sam Zell ‚Äúconventional wisdom is almost always wrong‚Äù don‚Äôt listen to people and just fucking do it! I would use fiverr and upwork or find an American app building dev to hire people on the side to build it for you. Or you can find a chiller 40 hour a week job and free more time to do it yourself My thoughts if you make that much. Grind it out til your 30. Try so spend every dollar on real estate. Paid off. If done correctly you should profit from the rental income. Take line of credit and continue real estate. Use leftover cash flow to be a start businesses. Also learn the difference between an entrepreneur and a ‚Äúintrapenuer‚Äù as Andy frisella says. Check out his pod cast really puts perspective on how hard it is to be a true entrepreneur. Biggest thing don‚Äôt try to be an entrepreneur and end up creating a job for yourself instead of a business. Stay put and keep studing your course of action till u see what happens with this new company coming.. it might help you figure it out by forcing a new direction Don‚Äôt leave a job paying that well without something else already in place.

You think they might lay you off? Fine, stay there until they do. But use the salary they‚Äôre paying you to start a side hustle and get something going for yourself.

And if the axe never swings? Then you will still have a job and a side hustle, and will be free to leave on your own terms, when the side hustle income can support you full time. Simplest and safest answer is ‚Äòdo both‚Äô.
There‚Äôs just no need to take such a risk.
Build a sidehustle in your spare time, and when your sidehustle matches your income, then you can pretty safely step away and work full time on your own business.
If the company you‚Äôre working for is due to get bought out, DO NOT LEAVE before. A few years ago someone I know faced the same situation. The company was bought out, he hasn‚Äôt moved, his shares were bought, nice lump sum in the process and he‚Äôs earning more too. Don‚Äôt jump early.
What to look into? My background (12 years) is ecommerce and consultancy. I‚Äôd say there are options in all kinds of ecommerce, but also potential for you to consider the same role you‚Äôre doing, but in a consultancy capacity. Further, online courses and resources aimed at restaurant owners/managers etc.
Good luck. Once you have a better plan than ‚Äúpursue entrepreneurship‚Äù, whatever that means, keep your job. Try to figure out what you want to do and slowly start building it up while keeping your job. Real question is what industry are you making 200K in @ 27...  I need a mentor like that... I'd just wait until the layoff and use the unemployment to live off off while you start your business. If you're passionate about Entrepreneurship, then you should. If not , then you shouldn't. I think before you quit your job you need a clear idea of what business you want to get into first, have you thought of any ideas personally yet. I‚Äôd keep the stability while building this on the side. You may need to outsource some things to keep momentum but that‚Äôs not a bad thing. 

Offload all the admin work / anything you can delegate, and keep using your brain for the important stuff. If you can get used to that, you‚Äôll have solved one of the core challenges entrepreneurs face in getting stuck with the ‚Äúbusy work‚Äù. Most entrepreneurs move into what they know how to do.   Resaturants in your case? I always advise to try and stay in the job until you're making enough from the side business to turn it into a full time job Build on the side until the business replaces the job income and then scale it when you fully focus on it. Pre plan and dabble while employed. Get layed off, collect severance & unemployment, hit the entrepreneurial road running. I suspect the folks at CloudFruit would love to chat with you Whatever you do, if you hire a personal friend. 

Set the boundaries from the beginning and make it very clear that this is a start up and their employment isn‚Äôt guaranteed for years to come. Every situation is unique, and it ultimately depends on what feels right for you. I was in a very similar position and decided to take the leap into entrepreneurship. Let me tell you‚Äîit‚Äôs a rollercoaster. It challenges your emotions, your resilience, and your drive. Now, 10 years later, I‚Äôve had some incredible successes, but also some tough failures. I do reflect on where I might have been if I had stayed in my corporate role, but the truth is, you have to follow your passion and trust your intuition.

That said, my biggest advice is to plan thoroughly. It sounds like you‚Äôre not afraid of hard work, so focus on having complete visibility into your path forward. Build in risk mitigation strategies to give yourself a safety net.

Here‚Äôs the most important part: Don‚Äôt jump into a business idea purely on emotions or the belief that it might work. Do your due diligence, research extensively, and create a strategic plan you have complete confidence in.

If possible, try to start building a revenue base while keeping your job. Job security is a huge asset, and it can serve as a safety net while you test the waters. Aim to reach a point where you‚Äôve validated your market (confirmed product-market fit) and feel comfortable that your savings ($100k in your case) can sustain you long enough to hit break-even and build positive cash flow.

It‚Äôs a big decision, but with careful planning and preparation, you can minimize the risks and set yourself up for success. Good luck, and feel free to reach out if you need some guidance - always happy to help! No What‚Äôs your goal? More hands on, or more passive? 

Consider buying businesses from boomers about to transition. Buybizsell. You can take over something and run it on your own, or you can hire a COO to run it for you and you take a more passive role.

Either way, save up cash for capital expenditures and learn everything about whatever you are interested in. No I wonder what job or industry allows you to have this salary. My advice: if you don't even know what to start, don't leave a job for entrepreneurship - find a place to start, interview your audience and qualify the idea. Some people will quit and go all in here, others wait till their product is developed and some wait until they are making income from their business. 

There isn't a right way as long as you do things strategically, but jumping ship with nothing in front of you is not strategic. Only $225k at 27? You need to get your life together. Bootstraps! If you need to ask on reddit what industries you could ‚Äòlook for entrepreneurship‚Äô, I feel like you are not ready to take the plunge yet The more you make, the more difficult it is to justify the jump/risk. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't.

Things to consider...

If your company is being bought out and you think you might get laid off, there is a chance you might be offered a severance package. Especially if they ask you to sign a non-compete contract. Maybe hang out a few more months hoping for a package and then use that opportunity to job?

What do your financial obligations look like? Car/mortgage payments? Health issues? Family to support? If you make the jump, minimize your debt first. You can always buy another car once you make it on your own. Reduce your debt so that bills don't stress you (as much) in the early stages of your new journey. Considering your salary, I'd discourage entrepreneurship unless it's something you're truly passionate about. Self employment requires discipline and responsibility like no other. It's not impossible, it just takes time and investment. 

You could find yourself working 10-12 hours, 6 or 7 days a week, making less with no 401k or benefits which in my opinion doesn't justify the ""freedom"". That doesn't include bookkeeping (reporting income to the IRS), employees, filing the proper documents for your business annually, etc. Really not trying to scare you but as others have said, I say trying building something on your free time and see if you really feel a want to keep it up! After 13 months of doing this and failing, I have set myself and my family back years. I took the opportunity and would do anything to get back what I have lost. You‚Äôre handling over $100,000,000 of business but only getting $225K? Someone is being shortchanged!! Do it on the side first. I am a software engineer and I recently got laid off. I was working almost 60 hours per week and also raising 2 young kids. I had a product based business idea when I was working but I had no time to do it. My day job was super demanding. All the people who think continue working while working on the side does not work does not realize that the jobs are not typical 9 to5 job. One has to work on weekend night. Now, that I am not working, I actually have time to think clearly about my next product. I think it makes sense to quit the job and give yourself time/chance as a entrepreneur. If things does not work out you can always come back to your day job. Yeah sure Do it, go all in. Do it right, do intense proper research and you‚Äôll crush that number. Ride it out til you get laid off. Then be ready to jump when it happens. 

With that salary, sure you could go somewhere else and make similar. But with your SKILLS, you should starts a consultancy within a space you‚Äôre passionate about. 

You‚Äôll be capped out eventually on salary for the rest of your life as long as you work for something else. Growing your own business provides you freedom and control over finances and what you want to do. 

Same thing happened to me, so I rode out my startup role then I got laid off. I was ready and in my first year, the revenue I brought in matched my salary. But year 2 now and I‚Äôm forecasted for 2-3x growth. 

Now‚Äôs the time! You‚Äôve got savings and if it doesn‚Äôt work out, you can go get a job. But i think you‚Äôll be surprised how much easier it may be than you think Nobody knows you here.    Too many variables.   I‚Äôd have to watch a 2 hour documentary about who you are and really get to know you before this question can be answered.   Just because you have the money to possibly leave your job doesn‚Äôt mean you should. Big risks yield even bigger rewards or losses, but you will never know what‚Äôs down there if you don‚Äôt make the jump for it. I see a lot of suggestions about doing it on the side but frankly in most cases were a job like yours which requires all of you in one peace to get it done, side hustles won‚Äôt get the much deserved attention to take off the ground. I know you have been in situations where it‚Äôs either YES or No, well this is one of it. Once again, big risks yield even bigger rewards or losses. Keep your feet on two boats.

Then figure out when you can get off the first 1. Can you start your own company and take the clients with you after the sale? Your non-compete may not apply once your current company doesn't exist anymore. I would look into acquiring a business that you can scale with your skillset. Don't start from scratch and find something where your skills will help a currently performing business become even bigger and better.  If you start from scratch it will require a lot more upfront work with potentially no return. Most businesses fail within the first few years, so if you buy something that already exists you will have a basis to build on. Why not start your own business doing the same thing?  You already know how it works? It is never enough by the way.  You could make $500k a year and still want something else once you get used to it. Question is what kind of entrepreneurnial journey are you looking forward to? I mean 225k is really lucrative, so I would suggest get some more industry experience and then jump the ship. Unless you have figured it out all How much have you saved up since you were 15? Take my words with a grain of salt‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm 29 and although I‚Äôm happy with what I have, I‚Äôve been struggling for nearly a decade since I dropped out of college. I‚Äôve had to fight for every dollar. Shit job after shit job (often two at once) until now. I‚Äôm reasonably comfortable in my day job and have enough time to really put time into a business where I bust my ass. 

I do lawn care and this year I‚Äôve (hopefully, it‚Äôs not official yet!) secured an investor who sees the hard work I put into everything and thinks there is profit to be made. My goal is $800k in annual revenue in 5 years. If I can manage to grow my business to that size and maintain a 20% profit margin, there will be ~$160k of profit for my partner and I. I‚Äôll likely get half of that and have a salaried position making ~100k per year to run everything. 

My point is that hopefully in 5 years after busting my ass to grow a business from the ground up, fearing that it could collapse at any minute, my dream is $200k per year. 

Obviously that‚Äôs not the limit of what can be done but it‚Äôs worth considering the fact that you‚Äôre already making more money per year than most entrepreneurs ever will and giving it up could be a permanent financial regression. My logic is if you‚Äôre working 80 hours a Week for 225k it‚Äôs not worth it- $54/hr.  it‚Äôs not yours and there‚Äôs no scaling.If somehow you can manage to cut the hours to focus on your own business go for it. Plan B) they fire you and you get unemployment for awhile c) if there are layoffs within company- request they lay you off and offer you a nice severance Good idea but i‚Äôd find out if there‚Äôs a exit bonus If you're going to start your own thing with a pure start up, SBA 7a is not going to be an option. If you're acquiring a business that's different. But the seller would have to open with you to provide financials and you will still need to throw some skin in the game. You should still go for pursuing your dream and would suggest sitting down and figuring out your purpose. That way you can really understand what kind of business you'd be launching and be successful at it Most people who end up pursuing entrepreneurship is forced into it. 

Maybe the corporate career was slowly killing them mentally and physically. Maybe they got laid off/fired. Maybe they lost all interest in climbing the ladder and will regret life if they didn‚Äôt try it out.  Maybe they found a new meaning / passion in life that can‚Äôt be ignored. 

I am a corporate citizen turned entrepreneur, and I will tell you that everything in entrepreneurship is harder, more stressful, and more consuming. But in return, you get what you put in it, you have autonomy (most of the time), and you have true ownership of your decisions: freedom. 

Practically if I were you, I would stick around your job. During any acquisition, you will be faced with either an sizable severance check (considering you‚Äôve been there for over 10 yrs) or a lull period where you don‚Äôt have to do much (bare minimum) and still get paid. Take advantage of that time to proof out your business (meaning you have proof that there is a group of people who will spend money for your business) before you take the plunge. Having an idea is only 5% of the battle if that. 

Good luck! I do some startup advisory on the side if you ever need to sanity check. Any interest in beverage alcohol? Might be an easy switch coming from your current industry and allow some of the same contacts to be clients. Major opportunities in DTC and e-premise, brokerage and SAAS within that industry. Build the business on the side til it's worth jumping over. Up to you; but if you don‚Äôt do it now, you will never do it. 

I dropped out of my masters to join a startup as a founding engineer.

Successful exit 2 years later. 

Bought a condo, a 911, an investment property and bootstrapped another startup with the rest of the money. 

Startup tanked this time. 

Went to working at corporate ‚Äújust for a while to get domain knowledge in different areas to boost my business acumen‚Äù

Inertia sets in, golden handcuffs click, startup dreams die.

IF you want it: either (1) keep your job and build your business on the side until it‚Äôs time to get on it full time, or (2) quit now and start your journey. 

I‚Äôd advise (1) because 100k will go quick, and also factor in a 6 month emergency fund. Keep your Job! Build if you work 4 days week use the 3 days to build the business. Do not leave job. Running out of money is no joke, it sucks. Then you have to pay people. I heard atm and vending machines can be lucrative.
To be completely honest, I made $202K this year in the cleaning industry. Just started cold calling and found better and bigger leads. If you‚Äôre a go-getter like you say, I would say try to work on your idea quietly for a while then put in 2 weeks notice to quit. If you‚Äôre really passionate go for it ALL IN ! 
If it doesn‚Äôt workout you got plenty of time to find work you love. 

If you‚Äôre not so passionate just try something on the side and see if it takes off or not. If you do, stick to what you know and hire the rest. Taking a large risk. I did as well, it paid off, but had multiple setbacks and tons of heart ache. I will say at 250k you can dollar cost average into the market on stocks you really believe in and buy real estate. The downside of a job is you‚Äôre on the wrong side of the tax code. Hard part of owning your own business is everything is in you until you do the work so it‚Äôs not. 

I typically tell people they can always get another shitty job if it doesn‚Äôt work out. You make a quarter million per year‚Ä¶. 

As far as industries, again, your advantage in the marketplace is your skill set and your ability to leverage that skill set to provide overwhelming value. 

Would I do it all over again? Yes, but much differently in some critical aspects. As a small business owner with a growing business, I still have a full-time job. I did this to make sure I could pay my bills and all of the income my business generates is out back into the business. 

It's hard work, long hours, but it's steadily paying off! My sales in 2023 were about 15k, and last year, I reached roughly 45k. With the economy right now, it's hard to say whether it'll be more than 45k this year but I at least have the security of my full time job. I don't make much from the job really compared to yours, about 40k/year but just think about what would happen if you directed a good portion of your full-time job into building that business on a consistent bases. You'll do a lot better than me!

Trust me, living with no stress (in regards to paying your usual bills) is the winning factor. Please don't give up your day job until you are 1000% sure all bills can be covered and you have a massive emergency fund just in case your business takes a dive.

Good luck! üòâ I just did this. I failed. Now I have a $250k a year job but it was a long shot. If I did it again I would build a super tiny MVP to validate the opportunity/risks rather than spend 3 full months building a great V1. Why not explore your options while you continue to work? Researching business models won't take you more than a week + 2 hours per day. 

  
Once you've dialed down what you want to do and then figured out what you need to do (in terms of daily inputs), start slowly while you continue and then by the time the buy out happens you should be able to get something up and running.

  
Also, considering you have 100k liquid, you will be able to invest in ads and such which will help you get your client base faster than if you took the route of cold outreach or content.

  
You have a lot going for you in terms of resources and ability. You're just limiting yourself by making it an all-or-nothing decision If you have saved enough fund to cover up for 6 months and you can build faster Read fastlane millionaire. Make sure you don't become a business owner which is a job in disguise. Definitely not 100% stick with the job and build something on the side. 

I quit my engineering job to start my own business full time. I have been in business for 4 years and I just started paying myself a 9 months ago. If that was me-Yes. But it depends on your risk-tolerance. Also, have a plan.  
(Also, understand that most people on Reddit prefer safety and security, so they won't understand the call.) 

I would not jump without having a direction. Usually your best bet is to do something that is somehow connected to your current success.

\-What do you do better than anyone else?  
\-Have you seen any needs in the restaurant business that you would be uniquely able to solve?  
\-Is it possible that you could serve as an independent contractor in that space?  
\-Could you be an advisor/fractional manager for smaller local restaurants?

If you are just looking to get into entrepreneurship, start with direction. Get specific. Usually it's best to start with what you know. If you have reached the ceiling there and still don't have direction, go get a job in sales. This is the doorway of entrepreneurship, and something you will have to master anyway.

The sooner you begin your journey, the sooner you actually learn. That doesn't mean jumping into THE thing, but definitely shifting into something else ASAP.

You'll get punched in the face. You will learn. You will grow. That's a part of it. No, imho just curious what field are you in to make numbers like that yearly? No. If you think you stumbled upon an idea that‚Äôs good, work at it in your free time. Ah, the classic ""Should I leave my cushy $225K job to dive into the unknown world of entrepreneurship?"" dilemma. Tough choice‚Äîwhy stay in a stable job with 80-hour weeks, no weekends, and a $100M portfolio when you could go risk it all for the *dream* of control, freedom, and maybe a *slightly* less exhausting life? But hey, you've got $100K in liquid capital and a credit score that screams ""I'm ready to borrow."" Honestly, it sounds like you‚Äôve already got the entrepreneurial spirit, but maybe just wait for that company buyout and get the severance package *just in case.* Do you know what business yet? What are you looking to gain (time freedom, autonomy, wealth‚Ä¶)? You‚Äôre on Reddit asking if you should quit your job to start a business. Ya you‚Äôre not gonna make it. Stay employed. Sure bruh No If you are looking for businesses to start, it might be worth your time to hear my story. I‚Äôm 35 years old, male, single father to a 12-year-old boy with full custody. I‚Äôm an ex-felon and ex-drug addict. I spent 6 years in my early 20s addicted to meth and heroin. I was on the needle and living on the streets by the time I was 25. Just after my 25th birthday I got arrested and went to prison for 2 years. In prison I decided I‚Äôd had enough and was ready for change. I obtained a GED in prison and read about 150 books, worked out, kept to myself, and finished my sentence early. Got back home to my son as soon as possible, and started the process of rebuilding my life. I was 27 when I got out. I‚Äôm 35 now. Over the past 7-8 years I have been working regular 9 to 5 jobs while working to get full custody of my son, as his mom was still doing drugs. I got custody of him a couple years ago and we now live together, and I‚Äôm ready to tackle my next goal in life. Of course the jobs I have been able to get, being an ex-felon with no college education, have been minimum wage or barely-above minimum wage jobs. This is not an acceptable career path for me. I‚Äôve attempted to get in at entry-level and work my way up but for one reason or another it never works out. I just got laid off from my recent job 2 weeks before Christmas. I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm not wasting anymore time with the 9 to 5 rat race and have decided it is time to use my story to help others. I feel that maybe this is why I‚Äôve been having such a hard time getting a ‚Äúgood job with benefits‚Äù. I feel I‚Äôm meant for more. During my addiction, there were many times I should have died. A lot of my friends I went to high school with died from overdoses or suicide due to addiction. I used to shoot up huge amounts of meth and heroin. I used to be in a lot of very dangerous situations. But I‚Äôm still here. I‚Äôm not religious, but I feel there is a reason for it. I feel I can use my experiences and my story to do a lot of good in this world. 

I am going to create a streetwear brand that is branded around my story, as well as other people‚Äôs similar stories. I plan to put out a lot of content, and a large portion of profits will be put back into doing good in the world. The brand will be for the outkasts that society thought they could write off as another statistic. Our brand will be for those who are here to show the world we are not wasted life, we are not wasted talent, and we still have a lot to offer the world. Our brand will be about resilience, self-discipline, and successfully pulling yourself out of the depths of hell. 

If you‚Äôd be at all interested in further discussing my plans for the brand, I‚Äôd be more than happy to chat. 

Nonetheless, good luck on your journey. Blessings. No you need that money to invest . Everyone else that doesn‚Äôt know will tell you the opposite Fu If you manage restaurants, why not start a PE Firm that creates/invests/buys other restaurants? Dude, you‚Äôre already set for life making 225k at 27‚Ä¶ you know there‚Äôs 50 year olds out there barely getting a raise to 70k? Just save and invest 50% or more of your post tax income for 5-10 years and you‚Äôll be more than able to acquire a multi million dollar business that generates 300k or more a year

I swear people on Reddit live in a bubble. [deleted] Literally sell a high ticket coaching program. I was in sales (door to door mainly) and now I'm in the coaching space and it's crazy. I just started 2 months ago and I've seen so many well known entrepreneurs talking about it. Someone like you probably has crazy amounts of experience and knows lots of things, I'm sure you can teach a lot. Pick something and make youtube videos and have a high ticket offer. It can even be $10,000 per year or $6000 for 4 calls. You can do lots.

Look into the Skool platform too. That's where I am. 

Here is my community in case you were curious üòÜ

But I would say do not quit your job. Entrepreneurship is uncertain and can take years. The only problem you currently have is the fact that you want to replace your 9-5. If you quit it, you will have the problems of:
-No cashflow (probably for a while, not impossible though)
-Lifestyle drop
-Running out of capital eventually
-Mental side effects of no income

And wanting to replace your 9 to 5. I would say just build it on the side. Ask for time off if you really need it. Work on it while at work. Wake up earlier. Do it after work. Use your current income to pay for very premium mentorships and ads. That's what I would do. Mentorships are KEY and with what you earn you can pay for the knowledge and skills instead of starting from the bottom.

And if you ever decide it's not for you just keep it!

Best of luck! Follow what you truly think is best, not because some random girl on the internet says something :) As an entrepreneur, I fully back this. Build it on the side and maybe find a way to hire people part time when it makes sense. This is the answer. Hea working 80 hours a week. Idk if he would have side time. OP, literally the average business owner starts at 40.

ignore the media idealizing young rich people and the social media narratives.

you have time. the good thing is your speaking up about it and trying to make a change.

just put as much time into learning as possible. follow your interests, heavily.

i decided i would give myself a learning budget basically allowing myself to spend as much as i want to learn whether it be on amazon books,¬†[trends.co](https://trends.co/)¬†($300/year)¬†or¬†[theadvault.co.uk](https://theadvault.co.uk/)¬†(free) or whatever. i needed to move forward, whatever that meant.

don‚Äôt learn about things you‚Äôre supposed to, learn about things that energize you.

for example, my first job out of college after i ran out of money as a music producer (i had a dry spell and pivoted) was working in music. while i was in that industry i started getting paid $35k/year in los angeles. not enough to live.

so i started experimenting with online businesses and after some trial and error had a couple wins on the side then got caught by my company and they didn‚Äôt like me building online businesses. so i went back to work and hid my projects tbh but kept doing it cause i loved it. then when i got good enough at coding i left the industry for a job that i liked more and paid me 2x and let me build side businesses.

so yea just follow your interests and stay focused.

i‚Äôve had multiple times i‚Äôve felt lost, just push through it and use it to fuel you. Abso fucking lutely this.  This is the way to entrepreneurship. Yeah, and also if there are layoffs coming, severance after 12 years of employment should be nice. Can always quit if you don't get laid off This Along with this‚Ä¶cultivate any relationships you can with potential capital providers in the industry. It may be your current owners who are being thought out. Anyone who has faith in you as an operator, with capital to invest who don‚Äôt want to get their hands dirty running the day to day. I agree. This is the way to go He works 80 hour weeks, there isn't any side time. This is the only answer. And for those concerned about not having enough time, I can tell you from real experience of successful people, you have the time. That‚Äôs exactly what I was going to say! BUT, if he is really working 80 hours a week I can see the issue with not jumping in fully. 

OP - list out monthly expenses. stack up some more cash and give yourself a runway (even though it sounds like you already have a decent one). 

Jump in, with your experience the worst case scenario is you going back to something you‚Äôre already doing. I agree, you just have to pull out a scale and see where it takes you (weighing pros and cons) This is the answer 100% this.

This is how we started. The stability affords the freedom to make sound decisions without the intense financial pressure of the entrepreneur‚Äôs business being the sole source of income. This is the answer. Ageeed I would 100% see if you can do both until you start returning a profit in your new venture and then can pivot to do that full time.  Good on you for doing so well! If I‚Äôm not laid off, this would be great If you're on track to become a multimillionaire anyway (ie if the business fails and you could just go back to the same kind of job) it could be better to start a company while you're still able to pull 80hr weeks and don't have major family/financial commitments. Thanks for the comment! The $100k is the liquid capital im willing to put up. This does not include real estate or any investment accounts I own. But I hear you great but the problem is he is sometimes working 80 hour weeks where is the time going to be put in for a business? Also he is making good money and in a comfortable position so there is no drive or risk involved How did this work out for you? Lying on Reddit. Not sure how you‚Äôd get to that level without developing some business sense along the way.

I work with VPs of fortune 100 companies who make less than that. Thats an option too This is the only one you need to read OP. Thanks for the comment, and yeah there are a lot of variables at play. I‚Äôm confident I can get another job in my field, but probably closer to $120-$150k. I appreciate the feedback This is good. I appreciate you! I‚Äôm prone to a bit of paralysis by analysis. So I see what you mean. What do you mean? Im curious Unlikely unfortunately yup I appreciate it. I‚Äôll spend a lot of time on this subject. Thanks!

And this news just broke, so I don‚Äôt have all the details yet. In my opinion, the company would beed at least 12-18 months to acclimate to our brand and so therefore I believe I‚Äôm safe for that long but beyond that, I doubt it. I‚Äôm sure they will train someone to do my job for less. I agree heavily on the ‚ÄòParalysis by analysis‚Äô. The fear of ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù. Good luck to you! I don‚Äôt want to in the short term. I‚Äôm concerned of the acquisition that is coming. My salary could be slashed, or position eliminated altogether, and I want to be prepared. Lol thanks for the concern. I guess I worded that badly. I don‚Äôt plan to leave right away, but I want to plan as if my position won‚Äôt be here when the acquisition happens. Good call ‚Äî Didn‚Äôt even consider this Just looked it up. Can‚Äôt believe ive never heard of it before. Thanks! Go to medical school at 14 I guess? Doctors don‚Äôt even make that until like 8+ years out of their residency. This is one of the biggest LARPing communities I‚Äôve ever seen. It‚Äôs like ‚Äúcomments under a porn video‚Äù levels of boomer shitposting, and of the posts that have popped up on my feed lately, half of these are clearly bullshit scams and the others are karma whoring. Paralysis by analysis is definitely a real flaw of mine. Is that what you think would hold me back from making the jump?

I value the opinions of those who don‚Äôt have any emotional or financial connection to me. Really? a 27 year old asking questions means they are not going to make it? What is wrong with you? I would agree, and I‚Äôm very fortunate and grateful for what I‚Äôve been able to do. I don‚Äôt take for granted my life whatsoever. 

However, I think you‚Äôre missing the part where I may not be able to have a job in the next 6 months. And relative positions pay significantly less [removed] This is something I‚Äôm looking into actually. I already advise franchisees within the brand i work for, but I‚Äôm not charging my own rate. 

I appreciate your help! On the side after 80 hours of work? How?? I like this suggestion to outsource ASAP. With 225k/year you can hire a lot of helping hands. Instead of ditching your current job, make use of that opportunity. [removed] great advice, esp the learning budget. Haha, oh man I‚Äôm just imagining that poor company. 

Could you imagine them having to lay people off. Pay severance. And then immediately after their star player that they kept decides to peace out too because of his dream. 

That would be some funny phone calls trying to beg someone to come back I'd wait. If you are laid off, you might be given a decent severance.¬† if your laid off then your laid off and can do what you were planning on doing anyway, why the need to jump the gun? your making enough that if you lived frugally for 3-5 years and saved 50% of your income or more (you could live off 75-100k a year comfortably) you could comfortably start a business or pivot. With your salary. It's better to invest than pursue entrepreneurship. Quit when your investment returns are higher than your salary. Disagree. Higher probability of OP becoming a multimillionaire in current job than risking it on a business. Later on, they‚Äôd have resources and more experience which would increase the likelihood of their venture succeeding. gotcha thats better then. you're in a great place. why would you want to give that up? Most entrepreneurs never make even 6 figures and burn out.... dont put entrepreneurship on a pedestool. personally i love real estate, why not just keep working on that? you have the income and capital to pursue it and its way safer than a business. Would say no. Best move would be look into FIRE. People don‚Äôt realize successful biz are 1 in 7. So you‚Äôll probably fail or break even multiple times. Youth is on your side. Compounding and the rule of 72 are the lowest risk for your money. It will double every 8years in a low fee ETF like vanguard. **""80-hour weeks"" is a good point.**

* He mentioned he's used to working 80-hour weeks.
* But didn't indicate if he's working 80-hour weeks right now or not.
* And while he has a job, he can work on pairing work hours/responsibilities back so he has more time to invest in a new business.

**""He's making good money so there is no drive or risk involved.""**

* ""Burning the boats"" is a good motivator.
* However, it sounds like his employment is about to be upended in the next 6 months.
* Without a clear idea or validated customers/income, it might be good to ride out those remaining months while he gets his finances in order and works on ideas.
* When they lay him off, it might also result in a severance which could be another cushion while he works on his business. It's still super early. I can give you updates through the year (reply if anyone wants that). I'm about to launch my saas in \~2 weeks, so I can't report success just yet.

This was very strongly something I've wanted to do for a very long time, so I really don't have a Plan B. It's start a company or bust for me.

  
I previously toured internationally as a musician, and as much as I loved that and found success there, I had a Plan B (software eng.). If you have a Plan B, you'll end up taking it when things get tough, every time. do you think you'll have enough mental/physical strength to build something on the side? you also still got time at 27, doing it little by little. I personally would have to move to an easier less demanding job to start doing something on the side What's the current job that pays 220k? I think the bigger red flag is that you don't know what you want your company to do. It's normal to be hesitant to make the plunge, I myself got cold feet the first time and waited an extra 3 months before quitting my job, but I think you should have a lot of conviction in what you're going to do.

If you just want to start a company because it's something that you have control over, definitely keep in mind that with that control comes a LOT of responsibility, and it's not the same as being an employee. You're responsible for literally anything and everything to do with the company, you have to be the one to identify what those are, you're not replaceable (which means even when on vacation or taking it easy you have to keep working), and you have to spend a lot of time being a manager.

It's very rewarding but TBH I completely get why even moderately successful entrepreneurs go back to being an employee now. It can be kind of nice to have clearly defined responsibilities, priorities, and tasks set by someone else. And there is a difference between going above and beyond at your corporate job working 80hr weeks and having no choice to work 80 hr a week. Startup and working a business is incredibly difficult and risky. You might work same 80 plus hours and still go down. Many people in entrepreneurship had little or no option.
You're young and have time. Hold your job for now. You have experience at it and, who knows, a new owner might consider you valuable. Then draw up some 3 to 5 year plan and war chest. Your 100k may not be sufficient runway. Startup and working a business is incredibly difficult and risky. You might work same 80 plus hours and still go down.

You're young and have time. Hold your job for now. You have experience at it and, who knows, a new owner might consider you valuable. Then draw up some 3 to 5 year plan and war chest. Your 100k may not be sufficient runway. I mean at any company at a similar salary My question is: you‚Äôve clearly seen/experienced a lot at a high level, and in the trenches. If a software, automation, or integration could exist that would be a ‚Äúno-brainer‚Äù for your current company (and its competitors) what would it be / what would it solve? That makes sense. Are there other smaller businesses that exist in the space you could join as a leader and/or are there other jobs where you could easily replace the $225k? Read the last part of my comment with the voice of Kevin O'leary Unfortunately, you need way more than 100k to leverage into an existing small business that's going to net you what your expenses likely are. I was just making a joke. Make sure you have a legitimate idea that‚Äôs starting to make enough money as a side hustle, before you quit your job. Cause once you quit, money runs dry real quick. See comment below. It's called consulting.  Not get rich quick coaching like he is representing.  Yes, consulting will be a great field. Doing it on the side could be a conflict of interest.  Just look into it. I read it as he is no stranger to work and he has done 80 hours a week at times. If he is doing 80 hours every week, he won't have time. If he is working 80 hours a week, he can use some of the money to pay someone to work 10 to 40 hours a week. He will still be better off than quitting and potentially making 0 for an undefined amount of time.

$100K in savings is good but honestly he is better off aggressively saving before he goes full time into entrepreneurship. I wish I started later. I would have been way better off. Exactly. It‚Äôs always easy to look at the other person and see how much success they have and compare it to yourself. You just gotta push through and not forget to have fun in the journey no matter how hard it can be Thanks man! At which point it would be perfect to have a side gig up and running If you can reliably find well-paying work it's not a question of risk that you will or won't become wealthy as long as you save and invest at least something. For someone in the OP's situation it's choosing whether to stick to the predictable path or take a risk and either greatly accelerate their financial goals or delay them by some number of years.

I have no idea what their personal situation was but I was actually in a very similar position a year ago when I left my job (paying about double what OP makes at Google) to start a company.

Of course you can always say ""I'll wait to start a business once I have $X"" but past a certain point those just become numbers on a screen and emotional-support-millions. It's possible OP is already wealthy enough to have met the ""have $X"" milestone.  Even if not, if they have a big financial buffer and set a deadline for when they'll accept defeat and go back to being an employee, the downside could be like ""hits $Xmm net worth at 52 instead of 49"". At least, that was my thought process.

\> Later on, they‚Äôd have resources and more experience which would increase the likelihood of their venture succeeding.

This is true but I would also point out being an entrepreneur benefits from certain kinds of experiences and skills you can only get from actually engaging in entrepreneurship. So if OP really wants to be an entrepreneur long term it could be beneficial to start building those skills early. Personally I believe that I have learned much more in the past year building a business than I would have working at my prior job, and my network has expanded at a dramatically greater rate than it did as an employee. But that probably did come at the expense of other skills that I would have been able to dedicate more time towards. Overall still very worth it IMO It‚Äôs not so much that I want to give it up but more of coming up with a game plan for when the acquisition of the company happens. 

Real Estate is also an option, but I wouldn‚Äôt have the purchase power to have enough properties to support myself. I also enjoy the grind, and through this, I would have full control. I succeed or fail on my own , and am not reliant on my boss or a PE firm for my success Hey, thanks for the insight ‚Äî I appreciate it!

My work week is definitely not a 9-5. It is very dependent on a lot of factors, some weeks I work 30 hours, some weeks I work 80+. Its a very inconsistent schedule. 

I don‚Äôt intend to just quit tonight, however I want to set myself up in the event that this PE firm no longer deems my position necessary. I‚Äôve always loved entrepreneurship, and want to get started now to have the ability to potentially quit, or be happily laid off in the next few months its a good point but im assuming he's working more than a 9-5 just based off his job and the context. even if he had a 9-5 it would still be a little bit of a burden trying to start a business but its not too bad. Its not totally clear that he is going to be fired in the next few months but If that does happen I would get the business slightly off the ground, and do all the hard stuff, then go get another calmer job until the business starts making consistent money definitely interested too see what happens lmk in a couple weeks His dad owns the company. OP says he started there at 15 years old. He won't be laid off by his dad, he's just humble bragging. It's called being in a fake job are you talking to me? Ahh gotcha. I appreciate the feedback. OP just needs to make sure he's living like a normal person making 60-100k.  Hopefully they've been saving that insane money instead of spending it and living at/above their means. Thanks for elaborating on your points and sharing them. everything youre saying is what 'entrepreneurs' online pretend the reality is. your 'grind' often has nothing to do with your success. its mostly luck, or building upon previous knowledge. most successful entrepreneurs use their industry connects and experience to launch their own business in a very similar industry. they don't just start from scratch and 'hustle'. that doesn't exist in reality. ask yourself - do you really 'want' this so badly, if you don't even have an idea yet of what to do? Do you really want it so bad if you haven't even started yet? Why didnt you start 7 years ago? Why are you posting online asking strangers? ah okay I understand. A good idea is if you want you can start doing some research if you want to get a llc or not and get some of that out of the way whenever you have time. Also it doesn't matter much but do you have any experience with entrepreneurship? May i ask what you do for work? Sorry dude. Talking to OP. Screwed up the reply. Don‚Äôt overthink it. Find something your passionate about and chase it. Work your 9-5 and do your start up. Eventually you can quit the 9-5. Yes it‚Äôs hard as heck, yes you grind out 80 plus hours a week with no sleep. But you gain freedom and time after a while. But can you live on a modest salary? You need to be prepared to not pay yourself. I luckily had a spouse and a nursing degree to ‚Äúcatch a PRN shift‚Äù when money was tight the first year. My business is huge cash front loaded and we invoice after services are provided. You just have to have a plan. I started with almost zero Capitol. Borrowed a little when payroll was short and learned fast to forecast payroll. If your dream is to purse entrepreneurial endeavors, you will love the process. Seek help from the Sba in your area and do the class drop-ins etc. I feel into my business bc I was laid off. This right here. Lower your expenses as much as possible, if you can live like you are making 80-90k a year. As far as industry you must be a very good at what you do, unless you hate your job I would stay in that industry and open your own restaurant or consulting. Also start by partnering up with someone, by equity 10-20% as a partner and move up from there. Makes sense. I think being in the thick of everything has blinded me in a sense. I‚Äôm glad people are being real with me, and I appreciate your hard but honest questions. These are all things I need to consider, and I ask you because of the wisdom and insight of people who have been in my shoes before, and that have no emotional/financial tie to my situation. Thanks for taking time your good I was confused for a minute üòÇ i worked a fulltime job and started my own business. after 4 years of running it, it still wasn't half of what i made at my job. shits hard. i started another business in real estate after that which took off, and did enable me to go fulltime. just keep trying things until it works. but dont give up your safety net until then, its not worth the stress. theres nothing wrong with a 9-5. if your working too much, maybe find a new company. [removed] Is it any different if acquiring an existing business vs building from scratch?

Meaning will the advice be any different? rentals + airbnbs existing businesses are way safer to invest into. obviously takes more capital up front, but is easier to run since you retain the labor. You can do it more easily while working a 9-5 as well since you have income to qualify for business loans.",2025-01-12 19:59:11

My plan (I have semi pitched to him ) is that we make a business Idea I set it up while he's at the army college and then we run it together till he goes to the army and he keep a small bit of ownership . Other plan to get rid of the business when he goes or sell it off . This means we can do our interail travel around Europe idea . 

This idea would have to be online so we can do it while travelling also doable by one person . Mainly this is because my mate will have basically no money for the trip and I'd rather not be the one paying for everything 

If it's profitable I'll keep it going if notcill sell it or just shut it down . It'd need ls to be enough to buy food , a couple nights in a premier inn and then the bills he'll have to pay in the couple of weeks we're gone

I live me Melbourne, Australia with a decent paying job - but i don't feel fulfilled! I am content with my personlal life but i hate the corporate world, i despise working ONLY for profits (i am in sales dealing with AUS major supermarkets), i feel like i am in a rat race trying to climb the corporate ladder, but for what... what am i actually achieving apart from earning a bit more money every couple of years? more and more i feel like am an accomplice in a crime by feeding people poison with all these new chemicals we're adding in our daily foods. There is no wonder why there is a health crisis. I picked up bread of the shelf the other day and it had 10+ ingredients.. wtf...

Working within the food industry, i am appalled by the direction we're heading in terms of all the additives/preservatives we add into our food (long term affects of which i still unknown) just to prolong shelf life of products to ensure bottom lines are never comprimised. 

i want to do someting about this - i have a few ideas and think there is a gap in the market, but where do i begin? i don't have any enterpenuer friends/family, how do i validate these ideas? i don't have the capital to invest in a new venture and don't know how i could dedicate enough time to persue this if my wife and i were to get pregnant. 

Has anyone had a similar experience and how did you manage? ","Ideas are the easiest part of entrepreneurship. You don‚Äôt have time, money or experience. Try to get two of those before trying this What are your skills? What can you do very well? I would start from there and then think where you can apply them so it's the most fulfilling to you.

There are opportunities for NGO or volunteer work but it's usually unpaid. Paid positions are harder to find but you might be able to find a startup which has a cool mission.¬† Ok. Start with your target audience. Who are they and what problems do they have. Be very specific and remember that the target audience may change. You need to begin by really understandingyour customers and their problems and find a problem that is really big and that they are willing to pay money for.

Ycombinator has good videon on youtube and a startup school there. Alex hormozi has a podcast and video that is pretty helpful.

 But bottom line find who your target audience is, who yiur customers are and what their problems are. After that find a solution/product and test it until you found something that works and then try to scale the business from there Hello, me from Australia.

I‚Äôm 35 from the US in the same exact boat. Our food is poison and killing everyone and amazingly enough, people STILL aren‚Äôt realizing it despite almost half of this country being obese and everyone having chronic illnesses.

I have ideas as well but that‚Äôs where it ends. I need more capitol before I can start making moves Easy situation create MVP >i hate the corporate world, i despise working ONLY for profits

I feel deeply identified with this. But I also feel that I haven't been able to define or even understand exactly what would be the type of work that I'd like to do instead. I often imagine that it would involve, somehow, building or creating something, rather than keeping some process running. Something like what? I'm not sure, maybe something, concrete, palpable, that I can see and touch, and with a visible impact on people, so that I can witness how my effort and my creation is somehow improving someone else life. Being able to see how people's lives are improved by the fruit of your work I think would be fulfilling, specially if you can have direct feedback from them.

I am a mechanical engineer, 39yo, and since I graduated I worked in corporations, putting effort on activities whose whole purpose is making my employer richer. I don't see where all my energy and effort is going, other than a salary at the end of the month. I feel I am prostituting myself, and that I am not being loyal to myself. But honestly I don't know what to do, I feel pretty much useless, like I only know how to get ""fed in the mouth"" (if that makes sense in English) by an employer :/ Simple.

Connect the dots:

Retired single Seniors living alone. Can‚Äôt be bothered to eat healthy because they don‚Äôt know how.

They‚Äôre also lonely.

Family concerned about their health.

Opportunity to meet and socialize AND learn to shop healthy.

Apply your knowledge of food brands, health, and where best to shop.

Start thinking networking/business partnering.

Now think about putting the pieces together in your local business ecosystem.

Educate, socialize, exercise, give meaning to those golden years, direct members to vetted supermarkets, extend mission to realize ‚Äúthe healthiest years of my life.‚Äù

Google ‚ÄúRichard Simmons.‚Äù Can you think of a ‚Äúsimilar model?‚Äù

Loneliness and

Seniors are not the only generational cohort when it comes to poor eating habits and loneliness.

Start mapping your ideas. Capture them on paper. 

When you find one that both fits and gets you excited, time to start working out the details.

Business strategy formulation, translate idea into a business model, draft a business blueprint, translate blueprint print to a project plan. 

Now you can work on the profit projections for setting goals and objectives. Identify tasks, people resources, operational resources, milestones, and timeline.

Donut tell me that Melbourne doesn‚Äôt have existing businesses that could use a steady stream of new customers/clients. Start thinking bartering of physical resources and how you will connect and engage with your target audience.

GROK your audience(s) and make sure to understand any benefits to their circle of family and friends. Don‚Äôt just quit you job first. 

Do as much as you can on the side

Perhaps you might come to the same conclusion why the corporation you hate so much‚Ä¶. Have a reason to Value profit first 

The food business famously have the lowest barrier of entry with the thinnest margin. And it‚Äôs a very labour intensive business unless you have a huge capital initially for automation 

As an employee you are only seeing one side of the equation. Hating the profit first mentality ngl is a red flag imo that you have not seen or touch the actually business/ number side of the industry.  Sales/ revenue is just one part of the equation. In the food business the bottom line make and break everything 

There is nothing wrong with wanting to do go having morals. But none of that matter if you can‚Äôt profit and continue to be in operation. You need to bridge that gap between your idea and how to make it commercially successful Holy sh*t, dm me lol .. I am on the other side of the world in US, but I am as passionate as you are about safety, I have a toddler and equally appalled at what the world is pushing on kids.. that‚Äôs my SaaS platform in the making.. I have a secret sauce too to make it standout Step one, buy land with at least a couple workable acres. Begine by seeing if there's a startup near you with similiar goals. Study their failures and success. Join or just learn and keep learning. 30M Brisbane, got a 18 month old kid and have recently moved away from corporate life into my own business.

I couldn't handle the groundhog day work anymore so took the plunge. I'm making a hardware product.

You could start by making some socials media short form content around what you're talking about, what you're passionate about. Make some short video's using your expertise and experience highlighting things that your typical consumer would overlook. 

If you start with the people group you want to help, learn all about them. Try have them find you on social media. That way when you have your thing you want to sell, you already have the people to sell it to.

I've been going deep down the entrepreneur rabbit hole the past year, and it is definitely worth the effort. I've learned so much so fast üòÇ

If you want to chit chat more feel free to shoot me a PM. Good luck! Literally am baking bread rn and thought it would be so nice just to make bread everyday lol.

Also isn't bread supermarket under the ultra processed category? create content around these topics, and find if there is actual audience for this. if there is no audience, it will require many failures and time to accomplish your goal. 

there are many people who do business with a vision for a healthy future. learn from them.  
learn what they do, try it yourself, see if it works, pivot if it doesn't, learn, try...   
  
as long as you have the desire, you will find a way. it may take more time than you want or in Hours! I don't have answers, but I would give the same advice I would give someone who wants to install a solar power system in their house and go off-grid (it's and illustration, so bear with me...): if you look at the price tag for a solar power system based on what you currently use (panels, batteries, wiring, installation, inverter, hardware, etc), you will poop your pants at the price tag, and just give up before you begin.¬†


To make that price tag make more sense, you first reduce - switch electric cooker to gas, change inefficient lightbulbs to LED, put in insulation, and so on. Then look at what you now need, and because you simplified, the price tag for going off grid becomes realistic. And if you still don't go for it, you win anyway because you took a big dent out of your power bill, which will make life better in a year.¬†


The same thing applies to simplifying one's life and trying new things. Just like going off grid, you need lifestyle changes and investment in things that will only pay off after some time passes, along with new habits, and a team effort as a family.¬†


So sit down with some coffee and a blank sheet of paper, talk with your wife, and look at how you can make your lifestyle simpler, and then your family can set good medium-term goals that make life better and more meaningful.


I have done this two times in my life so far, and am preparing for a third jump to better things. It helps that my wife has exactly the same viewpoint, so we work well together on pushing for more meaningful life. I wouldn't say it was easy, especially being originally from [REDACTED], where life is tough and one needs to be quite aggressive about personal goals, and now living in [REDACTED], which by many standards is an even more high-pressure country to live in. Yet, we have kept our lifestyle quite simple, and therefore more flexible for new opportunities.¬†


I would suggest that without neglecting your wife, kids, and current job, steal regular time for working on a side project, even if it means getting up earlier.¬†When I was new in [REDACTED], I found that meetup.com was good to find groups of other tech people and groups who were working on business ideas, and making a trip once a month to join these kind of events was very beneficial.¬†


Everybody says that you should rely on the job you currently have to then have security to slowly work on other interesting stuff, and they are absolutely right: jumping out of a crummy but well-paying job into the blackness to try and follow some dream is a great way to get grey nose-hair and maybe a divorce (opening a restaurant is a really good way to do this if you're interested). The more boring thing to do is spend less money on weekends and regular holidays, and spend a few hours a week on one good project, especially if it helps you network and see where that takes you.¬†


Hope this provides some ideas.¬† Entrepreneurship when you start solving the problems you‚Äôve identified. Lack of skills, capital, experience, etc. solving for this is where the money is made. test with a side hustle - small franchise type deal.  I dipped my toes into self employed by selling ads in small newsletter franchise - learned a lot - made some money.   Then I knew  I could do f/t and I got 3 more franchise and grew it and flipped it out and got into bigger business that was non franchise.    I only say franchise as its a proven winner - don't have to wonder how - they tell you!  And by small i mean like $3k investment type ones. Maybe by learning the science behind those additives. KYE + you'll have an (even more) informed opinion. Also, having a large mortgages kinda has the tendency to keep people in the rat race. Most American states have a ""cottage bakery"" law that allows any food that does not need refrigeration to be made at home with a home kitchen licence.

Australia may have a sjmilar process, starting a bakery as a side business that serves natural sour soudough may be a start.

Looking for advice and suggestions","I am a web developer with 14 years of experience. Since the end of 2023 I‚Äôve been serving this multinational company maintaining Shopify stores for their clients.

Currently trying to negotiate a severance/settlement amount with the company that would probably result in $10k - $20k after taxes considering the length of my fixed-term contract that is supposed expire by the end of this year.

I have some freelance clients outside of my full time job for web development that would also help me a bit in the meantime. On top of the settlement I‚Äôm receiving.

That being said, I feel like this might be the perfect opportunity to take a couple weeks off to recharge (I have been severely hurt mentally due to the toxic work environment) and then start my own thing.

I tried applying for jobs but the market looks so terrifying (100s of applications for entry level roles) that I am almost certain I don‚Äôt want to get back into another full-time job and would rather try to utilize these funds to sustain for the time being and try to kickstart something of my own (and so many rules and requirements just to land a freaking interview!!)

I continue to receive attention from potential clients (from word of mouth and LinkedIn) I feel like I might have just enough to start my own agency.

That being said, while I may have good communication skills and my work speaks for itself for the most part I am completely new to entrepreneurship and marketing and desperately need to connect with other entrepreneurs especially those who‚Äôve been in the market long enough.

Also my ADHD just makes it worse with all the overwhelming thoughts like ‚Äúwhat services to offer?‚Äù etc etc.

I‚Äôm both excited and nervous. Any advice and suggestions are welcome. You can also reach out to me with help/ideas :)

Really lost on where to start‚Ä¶ so many options","Good luck. Once you land on an offer, make sure you choose one acquisition channel and just focus on it for a few months.


It's so easy to try one, see no results, move to another and after a year, not get any results although you ""tried"" many things (been there!)


Treat the beginning as a job...clock in, clock out until you get enough $$$ coming in a consistent basis.


Apart from that acquisition channel, I'd also create a couple videos every week. You'll get a ton of traction on LinkedIn that way and that will lead to inbound work. If you need ideas, copy/steal what works on X/TikTok from people in your niche Ah yes, you have to select a niche and run with it for a bit. THen grow and scale. Where are you going to sell? Do you have a website of your portfolio? I think you could get funding. where are u located? If you have 1 year of income saved up, I say just go full into trying to get clients for your new agency.

The experience will be good for you whether you fail or succeed.

I will say, being an agency is a grind. 

Focus on recurring revenue and retainer income sources. 

Since you have a specific Shopify niche, that will help you focus, find clients, streamline workflows, etc.

But this will be good for you. Focus on Sales.

hire for fulfillment and check their work.

all the best üëç It sounds like you have been through a lot, and taking time to recharge after such a toxic environment is absolutely necessary. However, I want to challenge the idea of jumping into starting a business out of frustration. Running a business requires a clear plan, not just for today but for the long term, and frustration with a previous job is not always the best foundation.

You have had the safety net of a steady job, but as a business owner, that safety net disappears. Your freelance clients may provide some short-term stability, but client pipelines can dry up unexpectedly. How would you sustain yourself if that happened? It is important to think about whether you would be using up your capital too quickly while trying to get the business off the ground.

Before taking the leap, ask yourself these questions. Do I have a clear plan for the services I will offer, and is there demand for them? Am I prepared for the ups and downs of being responsible for finding my own clients? Am I passionate enough about this work to tackle the challenges of entrepreneurship?

It is also worth reflecting on what frustrated you. Was it the specific company or the nature of working under someone else? If it is the latter, running a business may not necessarily solve the issue, as you will still be dealing with clients and their demands, often with more pressure.

This might be the perfect opportunity to take a break and reassess your priorities. Consider speaking with experienced entrepreneurs to understand what is involved. If you decide to move forward, ensure you have a solid financial and business plan to avoid burning through your settlement money too quickly.

Entrepreneurship can be rewarding, but only if you go in with your eyes wide open and a clear strategy. Use this time to decide what is best for you, whether that is a better job environment or a carefully planned venture. You want to start an agency, and you already have customers lined up. The hard part is done: Knowing what you want to do, and knowing there‚Äôs an immediate pipeline of business.

If you can serve these customers without spending any money then you‚Äôre golden: profit on day 1.

Avoid spending money unless it‚Äôs a guaranteed return. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking. The real gold will come when/if there‚Äôs a technology or SaaS idea that comes up because you‚Äôre either scaling and it‚Äôs hard to manage but you can see a solution, or you‚Äôre consistently hearing the same problems from your customers and you can build something (SaaS/AI) to automate it.

Everything can be iterative, including the business model and customer.",2025-01-12 16:52:04

I might be able to nudge you in the right direction if you DM me with specific technical requirements Difficult to provide advice without knowing the nature of the product. Too bad there are people here who like to share their experiences. Good luck to you üí™. Consider the following pitches, and decide which one is more likely to attract an experienced builder.

1) I have a brilliant idea for a new product that‚Äôs going to make so much money!

2) I have 100 customers who are willing to pay up to $500 / year for a product that solves this one specific problem that I am intimately familiar with since I have direct experience in this space. Every journey begins with a first step, you just have to start‚Ä¶ Find a product development agency who have the needed skills & connections to help you in creating your product. Just have it clear at the beginning, but never ever wait for things to be perfect. Just start when it is clear and develop along the way! If you need a website give me a dm ALWAYS start with competitor analysis, is my take. You can start doodling some ideas for your product, sure, but when you get that feeling that you gotta do it, you should first see the competition.

99% of the time, it‚Äôs being done, or it‚Äôs a dumb idea.  I think it‚Äôs really the 1% where you can identify a clear gap in the market where you can figure out how your product will fill it. It‚Äôs a fairly basic business 101 method, doing a SWOT analysis. Start there after some competitor analysis. Best of luck! Ideas are plentiful execution is everything. Don‚Äôt be afraid to share. It will help u understand if there‚Äôs a need and allow people to help It's not about having the best idea. It's about execution. I think you are starting to hit on part of that right now, if just having a good idea was enough you'd already have money. We were in a similar position, found a developer, flushed out an concept and have presented to first group of what is known as a control group for feedback and to decide if we move forward. Just waiting for the results right now. Good luck Read Lean Startup I can give you some starter advice if you want (though I am also working on something with a big screen).  If you aren't too far into it and our ideas are complementary that could work out perfectly.  I feel you on putting the idea out there, there is plenty of theft (though it's also true that you get far more help by sharing than protecting).  I'm also working on a startup accelerator to solve some of these issues of trust (maybe). Hey hit me up and we can discuss the specifica Ideas are easy; executing the idea is difficult. If you are looking for someone to code some software that you will use on a large screen per customer? I don't know your idea, but I know that doesn't sound profitable. Tough to say; it is impossible to give a reasoned answer with this level of detail. Good luck. As I don't know what your project is about I will tell you at least my experience of entrepreneurship with ‚Äúscreens‚Äù, the idea I had consisted of a software to replace paper orders in restaurants, automation and digitization of orders, these came to a screen in the kitchen, mcdonalds style but usable software for any restaurant.

Here is the problem, a product with a big screen requires a big initial cost for the buyer, although you can offer free trials or other marketing strategies for your first sales, the screen cost is still there, the risk is not only to invest in the screen, you must make sure that your customer would really be willing to buy what the product is worth, if the initial price makes sense for them or on the contrary your offer is not attractive and you should give it a twist, maybe lighten costs. Your first prototype is to get a no-code example working, highlighting the central problem you're trying to solve, on either a tablet or monitor, put it in front of a few people that are your target audience, and ask them to pay so you can continue developing it. If it's not solving a problem out of the gate, it's probably not worth pursuing further. You could look into ""Glitch"" as a no code solution as well as Canva or Figma - but not knowing why a large screen is important opposed to an app it may be difficult to give you more advice. 

The large screen part makes me think it's dead in the water - unless it could be a projector. If you're in the US, there's most likely going to be a chipocolypse which will double or triple the cost of anything with a chip in it - including laptops, phones, monitors. Buying and importing large screens will be expensive and you won't be able to compete with global corporations with their own supply lines. 

Most failed businesses start with the solution, but not the problem. A problem can have a lot of solutions - some will be easier to turn into a business than others. I wouldn‚Äôt worry about sharing your idea. I shared mine 6 years ago on some user-specific subreddits. Got laughed off. No one stole it. Was pretty much the only one in my niche for several years, now a crowded space but we had first-mover advantage. Something like this is so complicated. Just go for it. Have fun, learn something.

There website has a bunch of good stuff for identifying where you‚Äôre at and how to get to the next step (your way forward)¬† First, sketch out your idea‚Äîwhat it does, who it‚Äôs for, and why it‚Äôs unique. Then, find people who can help bring it to life.

At my company, Rocketdevs, we help connect founders like you with developers who can handle the coding while you focus on the bigger picture. As for the hardware, look for prototyping services or even startups that specialize in custom electronics.

You don‚Äôt need to know everything right now‚Äîjust take one step forward, like reaching out for the right team. Your idea is the first step; the rest is execution. I‚Äôm interested. Schedule with me to discuss: https://calendly.com/grow-ventures-inc Get an attorney to draft an nda. Contact someone that can develop your product idea, have them sign the nda and then show them the product. Pay them to develop it for you. If this is several people because you need product design, coding etc. do that as many times as it takes to develop your prototype. 

Once you have a prototype, file a patent. Once it goes pending, focus group the use of said product with people qualified to give feedback (target buyers). Make basic adjustments based on your feedback for punched up 1.0 prototype. 

Once you have that and it seems like it works, do market research on who would buy it, what it should or could cost, and then contact various companies who could manufacture said product. Get an idea of price, timeline and volume. If you are worried about your idea being stolen, or tweaked just enough to not conflict with your patent which is pending, make them all sign your nda. I suggest remaining in the USA if the ip is too valuable.

Based on the info and feedback you‚Äôve gathered, create a business plan, I‚Äôm assuming you have a firm understanding on business metrics. I‚Äôm also assuming you are not wealthy, since you don‚Äôt already know how to do this, and your best guess at figuring it out is asking internet strangers on reddit.

Use business plan, prototype and market research to secure funding. This can be done by the sba, or private investors. Once you are funded, market, hire, train, grow, learn and scale. Not necessarily in that order. Alternatively use kickstarter or indiegogo or some type of crowdfunding.

Congrats, your super secret widget can now be at the mercy of your business skills and the free market. Send me a royalty check when you‚Äôre rich. First step: find customers This your first startup? Haha I agree that you can't develop your idea entirely alone, but that doesn't mean we have to shout out loud on reddit. It's a tale as old as time what is a kiosk company?  And if it is what I think it is ... what are advantages over hiring Elance (ok., it's new name but I still like Elance). 50k a year gross revenue is not what I would lead off with File patents first - providing it is actually, feasible - physically. Downvoted lol but I‚Äôd bet $ I‚Äôm right. Nobody with any sort of valid business idea cares about sharing it because who really has the time, money, vision and skills to put that exact plan into action. ‚ÄúI have a really good idea but I can‚Äôt tell you it pls help me‚Äù is just mental masturbation Definitely don‚Äôt shout about it on Reddit haha Everything is a risk trade off. I had someone say once that sometimes it's better to scream your idea from the tops of a building because someone who can help might hear you. 

Failing because someone stole your idea and out executed you isn't any worse than failing because you lacked capital and resources and took it your grave. Everything is a risk/reward balance. A company that specializes in computer kiosks. Think point-of-sale systems like the self-ordering kiosks at McDonald's. Or boarding pass kiosks at airports. ATMs are technically kiosks too. Any public computing device is a kiosk in my opinion. 

The advantage of going with a kiosk company is they have specialized knowledge. Any engineer can fumble his way into a working product. But kiosk companies have learned the hard way what works and what doesn't. And most kiosk companies have their own custom kiosk management software, which can be easily reconfigured into any use case. So they aren't starting from ground zero, unlike devs on upwork or similar platforms. Yea I‚Äôd probably go with ‚ÄúFor a product that solves this one specific problem that I am intimately familiar with since I have direct experience in this space, I have 100 customers who are willing to pay up to $500 / year.‚Äù Sure, I mean the numbers are whatever - hopefully you see the point üôÇ Can you file a patent before you know how it works? thanks - we dealt with kiosks before for public access machines - just never looked at it from a ‚Äúcompany‚Äù angel.

If you do not speak Japanese, they'll turn to others as they don't want it to be known, even if it means losing an opportunity. No meeting, nothing after the first email.

We rely on fluent Japanese/ English people to go in between, but even that is adding complexity and not foolproof, since it also shows some hint at their proficiency in English.

I've had conflicting advice, some say it's a good side earner, but not a real business.  Others say I haven't give it chance yet, and need to give it another 1k+ hours to start seeing results.

My sign on process can take 3-8 weeks but I work with mid-sized tech & robotics companies.

What do you guys think about it?","I think it's not a new idea. When Siri and other ""dumb"" assistants came on to the market, their shortcomings were immediately evident. Now we have a breakthrough in LLM technology and AI agents are popular once again, only because the shortcomings of LLM technology is immediately evident. Until we have some breakthrough in the AI Agent space, we're going to need more research...

My gut says our best bet is to make some nominal, novel, improvement in AI agent technology and hope to get acquired. But OpenAI will soon release their agents which will probably already solve those problems of agents. We cannot really do much with that? ü§î OpenAI is going to need buy-in from the industry to make agents work really well. It's my hope someone publishes an open standard for companies and developers to follow. (Maybe someone's already working on that?)

But also keep in mind that we already have voice powered applications. I can ask my voice assistant to add something to my calendar already. What we all want are autonomous or semi-autonomous agents running in the background. Think Jarvis from Iron Man movie... In order to do this, the AI agent needs access to data. With data privacy laws the way they are, and all those walled gardens, we need industry buy-in before anything meaningful can happen.

I want to start a car detailing business because 1.) I appreciate cars and 2.) It requires a much smaller initial investment money wise than a lot of other businesses. I was thinking of making it side money at first and then if I seem to be gaining good traction make it full time. I have 2 other brothers that said if I start to get consistent business that they‚Äôd pitch in labor and even costs to help out (be partners essentially) 

I know it takes a lot of hard work but I want to know if it‚Äôs possible to make a successful business when having a family.

Right now I am a school resource officer and work M-F 8-4p. I‚Äôve done Law Enforcement for over 3 years total but I‚Äôve always wanted to be my own boss and start something from nothing. ","That‚Äôs an exciting idea, and it‚Äôs definitely possible to build a successful business while having a family‚Äîit just takes careful planning and balance. Starting it as a side hustle is a smart move. It lets you test the waters without risking your main income, especially with a growing family.

Since you have brothers willing to pitch in, that‚Äôs a huge plus. You could ease into partnerships as the business grows, but it‚Äôs worth setting clear expectations upfront‚Äîthings like how decisions will be made, splitting profits, and handling disagreements.

Your schedule could work in your favor too. Weekends and evenings might be prime times for car detailing since a lot of people want it done when they‚Äôre off work. Starting with mobile detailing could also help keep costs low.

It‚Äôll be a balancing act, especially with another baby on the way, but if you‚Äôre intentional about time management and keep communication open with your wife, it‚Äôs definitely doable. Plenty of entrepreneurs with families make it work‚Äîyou‚Äôve got this! Prioritize. Create your long term goals, and include your wife. Once you've got a clear vision, don't make any decisions that don't align with the long term goal. 

For example, if one of your goals in building a business is to have more time freedom to spend with your family, don't book your calendar so full that you miss out on them. There's a delicate balance between sacrificing time for a better financial future, and sacrificing money today for a better relational future Of course it‚Äôs possible! Lots of successful business owners have families. It‚Äôs always possible as long as you let your family be involved in making decisions. They are in business with you as much as you are. My wife knows nothing about business but I treat her like a chairman. 

However, do a manual ‚Äútrade time for dollars‚Äù business is tough if you plan to do it on the side. You may want to consider a business that will be more hands off like a product that sells itself after you set it up. Or make sure you can get other people to operate it. You‚Äôll be busy enough as it is. 

Just speaking from experience here. It's possible of course! Is your family supportive of your idea? 
Do you have a business plan? My wife and I started our business when we had our first child. 11 years later still married with 3 kids and we hit $7m in sales this year. You just have to manage your time effectively, you can‚Äôt work 70hrs a week. We did it working say 50 or so and no weekends. Built the whole business around fitting into our life. Honestly there is ton of money in private security.  I would moonlight that Never mix family and money would be my advice Starting a business with a family won‚Äôt probably be the biggest hurdle. Likely starting a business *with family* will be the larger challenge. 

Having done both, I would do it solo if possible and hire regular employees down the line rather than partnering with family members. And if you do, make sure there are signed agreements in place. It's absolutely possible. I have seen multiple examples of people with families starting business. Seems like you also have a good idea of what you want out of this business in the long term, so that helps too.

  
Do it as a side thing in the beginning and you'll learn more about this world (demand, challenges, competition etc.) before you take the plunge. When I started my business I was 32, had been married for 6 years and had 4 kids. It started as a side hustle, 14 months later demand for my services had blown up so much that my wife and I made the decision for me to quit my job and commit full time to working for myself. That was 18months ago. We don‚Äôt regret it one bit. In fact in that time I‚Äôve been able to crush it so hard I‚Äôm making more than I ever have. I‚Äôm home for dinner every night, take off weekends and holidays, take my family on regular getaways and vacations. 

I‚Äôm a high school dropout with a criminal record (when I was 17 but still there). Had debt, a mortgage, wife and 4 kids to provide for. If I can do it anyone can. The ‚Äúsecret‚Äù - you have to truly need it to work, not just want it to work. Build up your reputation and key referral relationships on the side. Some sacrifices are gonna have to be made for this work, including some nights at networking meetings instead of at home and occasionally missing a family function for a meeting or one of those side jobs. Going out with the guys for a few beers won‚Äôt be happening for a bit either. If you aren‚Äôt at work or with your wife and kids then you better be building that side business if you ever want it to be your main thing. are you looking for investment ? Start small, focus on weekends, and leverage your brothers‚Äô support as you grow. Balance is key‚Äîcommunicate with your family and set clear boundaries. Thank you everyone for your input yall have given me hope, good advice and a lot to think of! If you like fighting with your brothers, go for it.

I recommend against it. Starting a business with a family is totally doable if you plan it out right. 

Kicking it off as a side hustle is a smart move, you can test it without risking your steady job.

If your brothers want to help, that‚Äôs great, but make sure everyone‚Äôs on the same page about roles and money. 

Balancing everything will be tough, but with some support, you can make it happen! You have some options and you might want to consider structuring it right so I sent you a message. Just reach back out when you get a chance and we can discuss more. If you have a steady job, I don't recommend starting a business. Unless you can guarantee that your venture won't fail. Thanks! I appreciate the comment some people seem a little negative and make it seem like it‚Äôll be almost impossible. I‚Äôm willing to sacrifice free time and a little sleep to get things going. I‚Äôll still make time for family though that will be a priority My main goal is just to make a decent living and be able to have more freedom I know starting out it‚Äôll be hard work and not so much freedom but later on that‚Äôs my goal I‚Äôm still at an idea now. I have until spring ish to figure it out since detailing is mostly a seasonal thing unless you have a dedicated garage you can use during cold/snowy months That‚Äôs awesome! How long until you made your business full time or did you put all cards in from the jump? Well yeah not immediately but I mean like once I get to a spot where I feel like I‚Äôm getting consistent business And do you have a garage? A business plan can help you define for yourself who your ideal customer is, what value they get out of your business (are you planning to be the most affordable option? Fastest detailing? Best quality work? Environmentally friendly products?) and tailor your service to them. Also it helps you define how you KNOW you've succeeded - or failed. What would success mean to you?

If you wanted to create scenarios, think of the hundreds of variations between verticals like SaaS versus consumer apps. 

However, other businesses need idea validation that could easily be produc",good,problem,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1hzmxkv/dont_scroll_its_worth_to_read_need_your_honest/,Don't scroll it's worth to read. Need your honest feedback.,"Hey founders! After seeing so many of us struggle (and fail) because we didn't spot the problems early enough, I built something I wish I had when starting out.

It's called Founder's Reality Check - think of it as a brutal truth simulator. You know those moments when you wish someone had told you the hard truth before you wasted time and money? That's exactly what this does.

What it actually does:

* Throws you into real-world scenarios (like angry customers + doubtful investors at the same time)
* Stress tests your idea with tough questions you'll face in real life
* Shows you your blind spots before they cost you real money
* Forces you to defend your assumptions (like why people will actually pay for your product)

It's different from just chatting with AI because it:

* Creates pressure situations (like real startup life)
* Tracks patterns in your thinking across different scenarios
* Shows you exactly where your idea might break in the real world
* Connects different situations (like how your pricing affects your growth strategy)

I'm building this because I was seeing many posts like ""I spent 6 months building something nobody wants"" or ""Just realized my entire business model doesn't work.""

It's like having that experienced founder friend who'll tell you the truth, not just what you want to hear.

Would love to hear your thoughts - especially from those who've learned these lessons the hard way!","I saw a similar thing on Product Hunt a while back. It's a good idea, but it's something you can just ask AI to do for you. Worth a shot, I'd def test it out. I would be interested in giving this a shot I advised a founder that creates a game like this. It didn‚Äôt work. 

Why? Because founders just want to build. Most don‚Äôt know what they don‚Äôt know until they fail. Most founders learn best by doing and hopefully learn more from failing. 

Now, as an education tool for potential founders considering a path or for a class, that‚Äôs another story. Education needs tools like this. 

Keep this in mind with founders. What they say they would do and what they actually do are very different. Trust me, I run a program with 609 active founders and 4,000 alumni. I‚Äôve been watching the behavior for years. [removed] Any 3rd party data or science that supports this? Not yet really. In the end the AI wants to please you and is not really critical. Even if you ask it to be critical it converges to being non confrontational. Yep gpt can do it but you should know how to make it ask the right questions to you and challenge you. Assume you are a newbie. How come you ask it? The hallucination will be high and make the questions sometimes not related to you. Just if we type assume this then it will do it for the first 3-4 chats later it will get lost AI isn‚Äôt there yet. It can‚Äôt accurately judge ideas, user experiences, and so on. tysm :) Tysm :) That's a great insight. But in which way i thought there would be people who wanted to get deeper knowledge on their idea and decide whether to move forward or drop it. Some people build their MVP by burning their own money. Should I need to give a try on this or should I need to pivot to something else? Maybe for the people who failed on their first startup this will be good I think.

If you wanted to create scenarios, think of the hundreds of variations between verticals like SaaS versus consumer apps. 

However, other businesses need idea validation that could easily be productized. For example, the creator economy and running a service business.

There‚Äôs a reason startups fail so much and it‚Äôs not a problem that could easily be solved or else everybody would have a successful startup. [removed] I'm not into business ideas. However, feel free to share  business *case* here in the comments and I'll give ya some feedback. For me it's less about hallucinating. It's just too damn pleasing. I can convince it of believing anything I want which is a problem. It does not take a firm stance and does check logical conclusions. Just like this sub it's just way too friendly and supportive which gives you a false sense of security. Can't be too critical in todays world which is IMO necessary as a good shake down for your own ideas, to actually try to not make them work. If they survive your own scrutiny then you may be have a good idea. Tysm so much for the time you took to write. The insights from a person working with 600+ founders is wow. I 100% accept the fact that no tool can validate the accuracy but what my tool can help with you is to take action decisions. Think like this people with limited resources/ saving they can't afford expensive fails, some people want to validate before quitting their jobs, people who failed more and want to take structured approach this time. I have an idea that takes advantage of the cost differences between countries to create a profitable business model. Here's the concept: If I have a partner abroad who excels at securing remote job opportunities, we could generate substantial income. For example, you could secure a full-time remote job that pays $1,500 per month.

This arrangement would allow both of us to earn $500 each every month for as long as the job continues. The more remote jobs we secure, the more we earn. With a large pool of educated and unemployed people in my country, there will always be talent available to perform the work. This creates a sustainable and scalable business model.

I have some resources to help I assume we‚Äôre all busy & have stuff to do, I don‚Äôt normally get on applications, just do text message. Maybe that would be a good place to start, if we all have iPhones then we can start there & add people from there. Thank you. I‚Äôm Hustling big! 

I have a bachelors from Johns Hopkins. I skipped a year and am also studying for my Masters at Hopkins. They gave me full ride 2x. Simultaneously I‚Äôm studying at American University for Education Masters in Teaching. 

I definitely would love funding. Had a friend offer me that. My thing is, I definitely do not want to waste any money. I think it‚Äôs best to do my first deal with all my skin (money) in the game then once successful, utilize more capital. 
*Whats your thought on that?* -Like real **solid** proof of concert. I‚Äôm working on a projet, it could be interesting to get your opinion about it. Can I DM you ? Absolutely!!",2025-01-12 07:33:02

I wrestle with these thoughts telling myself I can indeed do it but damn is this doubt persistent and strong. I guess I just want to know if anyone else experienced this in the start of their entreprenuerial journey and if there is a certain way you found to alleviate it? Or do you just have to push through the voices.

Edit: Just wanted to say thank you to everyone who took time out of their day to help alleviate some of my personal issues. Y'all have been incredibly supportive and given great advice that has been taken to heart. Not only have you guys helped motivate me to keep marching forward you have also inspired me to start a YouTube channel that I have been wanting to make for years as a passion project. Again, thank you. ","Some advice someone gave me that I found useful was whatever tasks you have, treat them as though somebody else assigned them to you. 

Create the tasks as a boss. Complete each task as an employee. It helps compartmentalize each step. And gives a sense of accountability. I find I get more shit done without thinking of the big picture. Those thoughts are normal, especially when starting something new. Doubt can be loud, but it doesn't mean it's right. Trust in the work you're putting in, take small steps forward, and remind yourself why you started. You're capable of more than you think! well, Generally spaking doubts and fear stem from uncertainity, you are not totally sure whether your idea is going to succed or not. good thing is that this is totally normal reaction. 

please keep in mind that having the courage to think of a business idea and actually start doing it, you are already doing better than most people and that you have it within you. most people would not bother. 

in my experince doubt mainly comes in the planning phase espiscially when am planning something and get stuck, what you can call creativity block. this can come either from a  lack of enough data, or that the idea is still not crystal clear in my head, thats when you feel lost sometimes along the way. 

if this is what you currently experience. i have a trick that i have used multiple time, with the help of chat GPT. 

Just put the below Prompt 

""I have a business idea that is not very clear yet. I want you to provide a comprehensive list of questions that, when I answer them, will help me develop a crystal-clear and refined idea. This stage is meant to clarify my concept and prepare me for the business plan and research phases. Additionally, include a brief guideline or hint for answering each question effectively"" 

Feel free to adjust based on your need. 

now chat gpt will provide you with a list of questions, put a little time and answer each one of them in a word document (or whatever you prefer). 

this works for me cause whenever i feel doubt (which usually comes in the form of questions) i would already have answers to shut those voices up. 

now you should be ready to dive deep into technical aspects and planning. 

\*\*another trick is to always dissect what you currently doing into very small tiny tasks, that when achieving you are by default moving forward into your goal. this helps me by focusing only on the task on hand (meaning my current goals is to finish this task and this task only before i think of the next task), 



All of this based on my experience and it helped me in the past, hope it does the same for you. 

  
PS. English is not my mother tounge, take any grammatic or spelling errors with a grain of salt. I understand how you feel‚Äîstarting something new often comes with self-doubt. When I face uncertainty, I turn to research and communities for guidance. As an entrepreneur, the best way to overcome fear is by taking action. Have an idea? Implement it. Consistent effort builds confidence. Imagine the worst-case scenario‚Äîif you fail, you‚Äôll learn and grow. The key is to be fearless, take small steps, and trust the process. Self-doubt fades when you focus on progress over perfection. Hey, you're not alone:) I literally get this kind of thoughts every time I come across a problem in my business. But they can be a good thing. Because it's an opportunity to choose (once again) to do what you really want to do, and it could also be telling you that you might be missing something. Maybe there's something that could work better for your business than what you're currently doing? Maybe that's what the voice is telling you? In a roundabout way. Totally normal to feel that way‚Äîit‚Äôs like your brain trying to protect you from risk. Starting something new, especially a business, brings up a lot of self-doubt for almost everyone. You‚Äôre stepping into the unknown, which can feel overwhelming, but it‚Äôs also where growth happens.

What‚Äôs helped me is breaking things down into small, manageable steps. Instead of focusing on the big picture of running a whole business, I‚Äôd work on just the next step‚Äîlike pricing, for example. Every small win builds confidence.

Also, talk to other entrepreneurs. Hearing their stories and struggles can remind you that self-doubt is part of the process, not a sign you can‚Äôt do it. And sometimes, yeah, you just have to push through the voices and trust yourself. You wouldn‚Äôt be thinking about this if you didn‚Äôt have the drive to make it work. I'm fortunate, because I do not speak german and the voices in my head do. lol

What you're experiencing is the result of 'change.'

Your brain understands what has kept you safe and alive in the past. It does not know this for new events and activities, so you're going to get a stress feedback. Ignore it and keep moving forward, because it gets less and less noticeable over time.

WIN!!! Daily.

I push past them. Luckily my passion and determination for my project can quickly override it. 

Maybe take a moment and write down the reasons you ARE the right person to be doing this job/project. That way you can go back and read it on days like this. I can totally relate to that feeling of self-doubt! It's incredibly common for entrepreneurs, especially in the early stages. Those voices telling you that you can't do it are often just fear and uncertainty speaking - they don't reflect reality.

Some things that have helped me and other entrepreneurs I've worked with:

1. Remember why you started. What drove you to want to create this business in the first place? Reconnect with that purpose and passion.
2. Start small and build momentum. Break your big goals into tiny, manageable tasks. Each small win will boost your confidence.
3. Find an accountability partner or mastermind group. Having others to share struggles and successes with can be hugely motivating.
4. Challenge negative self-talk. When you catch yourself doubting, try to reframe those thoughts. ""I can't do this"" becomes ""I'm learning and improving every day.""
5. Celebrate progress, not just outcomes. Building a business is a journey - acknowledge how far you've come.
6. Get objective feedback. Sometimes we're our own worst critics. Ask mentors or peers to give honest input on your progress and plans.

Remember, every successful entrepreneur has faced moments of doubt. The key is to keep moving forward despite those feelings. You've clearly got valuable skills from your ambulance work - now it's about applying that same dedication and problem-solving ability to your business.

Believe in yourself and keep pushing through. You've got this!

We created a startup to help senior citizens conveniently hire caregivers and nurses for their home care. I live in Nepal, a country with a population of 30,000,000. 

For context. Medics App helps you hire caregivers in real time. It has in built eMAR and EHR system, meaning caregivers would take care of patients and fill in records like blood glucose, blood pressure, his food intake, his activities daily, all would be filled using our Caregiver app and it would be visible in both web admin & in Medics Home app

The concept totally flopped as we came to know that people rarely trust technology in my country and that too with medical. We also failed in marketing as we were only burning money. We also tried phone call service to offer caregivers through phone call. But our burning was too high & we finally decided to halt the concept.

We have decided to sell these apps. If anyone wants to buy it we can negotiate on a good term. Also we only wish to sell to single entity or a person. We hope this concept works on foreign land. Thanks for reading :)","""Senior citizens"" and ""App"" should have been immediate red flags. No piece of Medical tech would be successful if it doesn‚Äôt come from a doctor. It is true and South east Asia, be it India, Nepal, Sri Lanka etc. Your target audience should be the adult children trying to take care of their elderly parents. The children become responsible, often at a distance, so it's them that need to hire in home help and monitor medicines etc. It's them, the children now taking care of a frail parent, that have the major headache to solve. Why don't you try to pivot it to other markets yourself? You just need to add more value to it, since the trust issues are high, why don't you propose something to assure safety of privacy like most apps do these days The use case isn‚Äôt a bad one actually, my wife works in this field and finding care givers is a major problem, however it‚Äôs not necessarily a ‚Äúfinding them‚Äù it‚Äôs a there aren‚Äôt enough of them due to low pay.

Even though this concept didn‚Äôt take off for you, it‚Äôs clear you‚Äôve learned a lot, and that experience will be invaluable for your next venture. Wishing you the best of luck with the sale and your future projects! When developing an app like this what testing does one do to see MVP? It seems like getting caregivers to adopt and use technology would be challenging. Why would we want to buy your tried and true tested apps that failed Am in healthcare and HIPPA compliance would be your biggest drawback.   Not certain but I think FDA or whatever body approves the app would need to be involved for approval. How many users do you have for this app? 

You can also try adding additional features like listing medical supplies and networking with doctors to promote your app. 

If one feature of your app is not working you can add more features like doctors near you, labs near you etc.

If you have already burned so much money, don't sell the platform or app; instead, try to improve the business model. Hi champ.. I'd like to understand more and also see your app.. how do I get in touch?
All the best üëç You are right. Sorry for not clarifying earlier. We did move on towards focusing on their children later. But that too didn‚Äôt work Maybe right maybe wrong, according to AARP 60-70% of seniors own smart phones and use apps every day. I have multiple seniors in my life from parents, step parents and aunts and uncles, they spent more time on their smart phones than my teenagers do. The key is the senior that needs in home heath care vs having access to healthcare services already. Most seniors, especially in the U.S. are on Medicare and/or have health insurance, so in home care is provided by their provider or telehealth. The problem isn‚Äôt their age or access to a smart phone, the problem is if they have the need for such a service. A 100% of doctors (we've interviewed) agree with that statement. I totally agree with you ü§ù Good point. I was gonna say the same It‚Äôs expensive to pivot to other market now. So we decided to solve other problems but learning from our mistakes and with a proper market plan We‚Äôve actually taken proactive steps to demonstrate our credibility, including obtaining UK certification to validate our quality and standards. Privacy isn‚Äôt a primary concern for our audience‚Äîour market‚Äôs hesitation stems from other factors that we‚Äôre working to address thoughtfully and effectively. 

Honestly, i dont know Sorry, but I said in the context of my country‚Äôs market, where technology hasn‚Äôt yet reached many senior citizens, leading to unfamiliarity and hesitation. This doesn‚Äôt mean it lacks value in other countries. Haha. Well it might work with a differently executed plan. Thank you for your kind words :). I will definitely check these platforms out and see if i can find anyone. Thanks for the suggestion:) I have seniors in my life (parents) and I don‚Äôt manage their healthcare, they do. Not until someone is much older 80+ and have dementia or similar would an adult child manage their parents healthcare. My deceased grandmother died at 98, she managed her own healthcare until she was around 95, which is when dementia starting majorly affecting her ability for self care and then she was placed in a dementia patient facility until she died 4 years later. Sent a chat request.   Send me a DM We're talking about Nepal here lol I second flippa, I have used it for the past 10 years and have bought many sites & apps from there.

What revenue number made you realize ""oh sh\*t, this isn't a little business anymore?","1M was special, but the real number is 15 to 20 employees, which is where communication gets significantly tougher and structures and procedures become quite important First 25k month made me stop and pause and say holy shit this thing is real now, not just a hobby.  First 25k week made me pause and be like holy shit I need more help. I can tell you the exact moment that ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù feeling hit me. Last year we had 19 employees and we‚Äôre doing over $10M in AR. Our employees are mostly remote, but we have an office in China where a handful work out of. We organized a trip for all employees from all of the world (North America, South America, and Asia) to spend a week traveling in China together. 

When everyone arrived, during our first night we were sitting in a private dining room in our hotel, filling every seat of this massive round dining table was when I realized just how big we were. I looked at each employees faces, some half asleep from their long 20+ hour journey, and thought to myself, damn, the shit I‚Äôm doing is responsible to feeding and supporting them and their families. 

After that point, my relationships with them changed a little. I no longer felt it appropriate for me to try to build close, friendship like relationships with each of them, but instead take on a more serious role as their leader and ensure the managers I oversee are capable to creating that warm, family friendly feeling many of them grew accustomed to me providing over their years of employment. 

We‚Äôre at 25 employees now, and when our next company trip happens later this year, we‚Äôll have at least 30. There are many ways for me to comprehend the size of my own company. I could count based on how much we spend on software licenses, how much our monthly payroll is, but for me, 30 people means we‚Äôll now need one of those coach busses for our trip this year. 

The last time I was on a coach bus where I knew everyone was a field trip in high school. It is still surreal for me the internalize what we‚Äôve been able to achieve. 

I‚Äôm sure before that moment last year I was able to comprehend that this company I‚Äôd been building for 10 years wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúmy baby‚Äù but something more. But my true ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù moment that will stick with me for the rest of my life occurred in a 4 star hotel somewhere in Beijing, China, when we all sat around a table for the first time sharing a meal. Shortly after I reached $2 million in sales. I ran my business by myself. It was quite the accomplishment. As an entrepreneur . I can start.  Build & sell . But terrible with managing and staff . Which is where the sell part comes in [removed] Not a number. When staff became capable of doing most things on their own, and revenue stopped being very uneven month over month. It stopped being me doing projects and started being me nurturing an organization. Never. In the multiples of millions.  Doing the same thing as before just at a bigger scale. We're almost at 1m ARR.

I was unemployed, trying to break into software engineering... At that time I had been practicing by myself engineering, graphic design, and studying up on running a business. I'm a master of none, but I get things done to a certain point.

Shortly after COVID lockdowns, and right before layoffs started, I started looking for an engineering job. At the same time I was building this product... Besides not focusing on one aspect of engineering, I tried different things throughout the years, and I believe that's why no one hired me at the time... Also, English isn't my native language, it's my third language, therefore I don't have the best communication skills. Basically, no one gave me a chance.

It was the last month when I could afford to keep looking for a job, or try to find success with my product. I launched 1 month before I was expecting to go back to Uber and other lower paying jobs that take up time. The first month I was able to pull over 1k. That was already significant for me personally. That meant that I could afford to give this a try for a couple of more months.

First year - close to 20k MRR. At this point, I felt that my skills are worth a lot more than I was hoping for. I learned a lot in the first year, but I was still wasting some of the time without a purpose.

Second year - close to 80k MRR. The second year was when I started putting together long term goals, creating structures within company, and felt a lot better about the direction company is going. The first 2 years, I constantly had a feeling that I'm missing something, or not taking into account something important. By the end of year 2, I feel a lot more comfortable with the bigger picture. I'm sure there are more things that I still don't know, but I believe I've thought through the highest priority aspects, and we should be able to continue further if focus just on those aspects of the business 

Now I have a team of about 20 people, but at the moment 80% is outsourced (planning to reduce outsourcing, if we continue reaching goals). Managing 5 people is different from managing 20, but it's challenging and interesting.

We're planning to grow the product we have 3x-5x, and we have about 4 other products coming this year - we built bunch of MVPs based on users needs, and we'vw been getting positive results with MVPs... Looking at your other comments, I gather my business is now an adolescent, in terms of your framework.

I suppose it began to feel like less of a baby when I brought on operations support/a non revenue generating position. This meant that I could step back from some of the ops/admin tasks and refocus on production/revenue generation. This was essential for my mental health, I didn‚Äôt realize how great the burden had become until it was lifted. I would liken this transition to an infant beginning to sleep through the night, or ceasing breastfeeding ‚ÄîI could leave it in someone else‚Äôs care on a temporary basis, albeit with a great deal of oversight.

It was a year after that I could take a week of vacation without a laptop. Then I began to pay others to do more of the things that I had previously done myself, and I generated the revenue to cover those expenses. That seems like a school age child to me.

Now (4 years in, beginning year 5) I think we are at teenager stage‚Ä¶things move along pretty well with less and less of my oversight at the micro level, and I can relax enough at times that it‚Äôs a bit of a shock to the system for me to realize how much I am still necessary üòÇ and that seems like an adolescent.

For context, I am a parent of one toddler and two adolescent humans as well. ETA: things felt like they had left the infancy stage when I was consistently producing a monthly revenue with margins that allowed me to replace my prior employment income. That‚Äôs when it felt real because it made sense for me to spend my time and energy there vs. employment. We do 5 million and it stills feels like a baby and I am still stressed.  Our customers go bankrupt, middle classes gets squeezed. I am name a dozen customers that would spend tons of money with us that went bankrupt bc of health, and weird economic stuff happening and leverage.  And every year some of our good customers move away to Naples and palm beach Florida. 

Don‚Äôt think it ever becomes easier. [deleted] For me - it was less about the amount of revenue, more about the size of the team and the number of activities I could step back from. We had a large back office in India with 12 full-time employees before I sold. When we onboarded the 3rd full-time hire and client acquisition, servicing and support all became activities that I could monitor from an arm's length distance, that's when I started to feel ""Ok, this is an engine now."" That feeling also came with a lot of responsibility, 3 people then relied on us for their livelihoods, as did their families! 

  
For that business, this moment came around the $20K MRR mark. From day one Probably 1 million but that was just met with ever increasing SKU bloat and expenses for holding more and more inventory. Something we are trying to work on by curating slow selling SKUs and we got payment terms with our main manufacturers We had rapid growth quite instantly so it wasn‚Äôt a revenue number. I stopped feeling like it was a baby after our first hard year. We learned and grew so much. Now with a team of around 30 very key people, it feels a bit more grown up and that feels so good to say. Wait.... businesses grow up!? I always thought they died from SIDS. /s


Yes, I'm fucking grumpy about my business. Still feels little at the end of the year. But it feels huge when Im closing contracts When I could go on vacation for a month and not worry about the damn thing cartwheeling into the cabbage. Sometimes wonder if it'll ever not feel like a baby to me This. I also noticed after 15 people you need to step up your management setup¬† I manage several sorts of operations in a healthcare company.  I have had to chew out my CEO/founder and other executives a few times for trying to act small.  When you're small you get used to the agility and the ability to move quickly with minimal planning, so it leads to ad hoc management styles.  

Ad hoc is not bad.  It is good.  There are real cost savings in some vertical integrations.  There are very few reasons why you can't do a lot of things yourself.  However, there is a point in a company's lifespan where DiY becomes DiWHYGODWHY.  

We went from 60-90 employees and our leadership's very hands-on management style and assumptions...broke.  We lost money and had to close offices because of this.  

The functions of management are Planning, Leading, Organizing, and Controlling.  I observed that when you're small, there's more Leading and Controlling.  When you're larger, you shift to more planning and organizing.  We passed 1M a while ago. Not a business owner but after looking over a team of now 20 at work this is true in the corporate world as well. 5x harder than a team of 10.  Interesting‚Äîthere‚Äôs a lot going on here. With the *Business as a Baby (BAAB)* framework, this stage is like a business in its teenage years. It‚Äôs not really about revenue at this point; it‚Äôs more about needing some kind of operational structure to keep things on track. Just like with real-life teenagers, if you let a business at this stage operate without structure with Adult privileges, it‚Äôs going to run wild. That‚Äôs crazy! Pretty cool that was probably the point when your baby business finally made it through. Amazing stuff! What's your business Interesting! So, after reaching $2 million in sales, you were running the business on your own? How did you manage that? That‚Äôs definitely an impressive accomplishment! I‚Äôm curious, what type of business is it ? The most beautiful part of this statement is your honesty about your strengths and weaknesses. You are clearly a builder, thriving when the business is in its baby or toddler stages. 

However, as it transitions into its teenage and adult phases where structure becomes essential, that may not be where you shine. 

What this means is that when the time comes for management and day-to-day operations, you just need to find someone to take that on. That way you can focus on what you do best, building and fostering relationships. I think your business is pretty much an adult now. It can run effortlessly without your input. This has nothing to do with revenue and everything to do with the systems you have put in place to ensure it operates smoothly with or without you. Well done! That is amazing. It sounds like you have grown from a baby to a teenager, though maybe not an adult just yet. Reaching that stage would mean being able to step away from the business for months while it runs smoothly without you. That is amazing! You already have a working system that you are simply operating on a larger scale. That is pretty cool üòé love your story you literally went from baby to toddler to teenager, when did you hire your first employee(babysitter) ? Yes, it is an adolescent (teenager). You are absolutely right. You need to create better processes and structure to ensure it runs efficiently without you. This will also allow it to handle a new wave of customers without breaking the operational infrastructure. Once that happens, it transitions into an adult, with a system that runs smoothly without your direct involvement. Let me ask you this: can this baby business cover your fundamental living expenses? If it can, then it‚Äôs transitioning from a toddler to a teenager. The next step is figuring out how to reduce your customer turnover rate. Why don‚Äôt you do this, let me send you an advanced reader copy of the book so you can read it before the launch. Then you can decide for yourself.

I graduated with my MBA in 2019, but honestly, it has little to do with my business acumen. I come from a family of entrepreneurs and literally grew up around the lifestyle. I watched businesses churn out other businesses that made millions. Despite that, my first venture failed. You know the saying: 9 out of 10 businesses fail.

After reflecting on what went wrong, I realized I had tried to manage a baby company like it was already an adult. That‚Äôs when the Business as a Baby (BAAB) concept came to me. It‚Äôs a framework to think about your business in terms of its growth stage‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a baby, toddler, teenager, or adult.

The book is about helping people avoid the mistakes I made. It‚Äôs not about guaranteeing success or being another typical ‚Äúsuccess story‚Äù book. What people often miss about success is that it‚Äôs influenced by many unseen factors unique to each individual‚Äôs circumstances. Success is different for everyone, but the reasons businesses fail are usually consistent.

I‚Äôm not saying this book will make you successful, but it will help you understand what stage your business is in so you can tailor your expectations and strategies accordingly. The BAAB framework isn‚Äôt just for one industry‚Äîit can apply across the board. For example, the AI industry is still in its baby stage. Its full potential won‚Äôt be realized until quantum computers become mainstream, just like how the widespread adoption of smartphones led to the boom in e-commerce and other internet-based industries.

Traditional consulting often applies strategies designed for teenager or adult companies to baby businesses. Everything I learned in my MBA was focused on managing established businesses. However, if you look deeper, even large corporations fail to properly manage their startups. Many of their ‚Äúbaby‚Äù companies fail because they try to manage them like adults.

Take Google Meet vs. Zoom as an example. Google Meet came out long before Zoom and had billions of dollars and resources behind it, but it didn‚Äôt take off like Zoom did during the COVID pandemic. Google Meet is like a trust-fund baby that didn‚Äôt thrive because it wasn‚Äôt nurtured properly. Most of the time, big corporations (the adults) end up acquiring new startups (the babies) to fill the gaps.

This framework helps you view your business more clearly, understand what stage it‚Äôs in, and make decisions with the right expectations. Business as a Baby is the first in a series. In the future, there will be books on businesses as toddlers, teenagers, and adults. That makes a lot of sense, that‚Äôs pretty amazing once it gets to a system with processes things change. What kind of business was it ? Hmm ü§î interesting what payment terms do you have with your main manufacturers ? That makes sense That is beautiful. Would you say your business is an adult now? Not because of revenue, but if you were to step away for three months, could the business run without you? why are you grumpy about your business ? What is going on ? and yes businesses grow up. I see what you mean, but at least your business is no longer a baby. It has definitely grown enough to cover your basic living expenses. I would say it is a toddler business. Do you have any employees? I see then it is an adult.  Perhaps you are a baby or toddler business. Sometimes it never does and when it is fully grown you have to let go, letting go is the hardest part Yes, that‚Äôs interesting‚Äîthat‚Äôs when businesses start to morph into their teenage phase, because, like real-life teenagers, they need real structure to stay on track. So basically, you all tried to manage a teenager company like it was still a baby or toddler, and that is the issue. Baby and toddler businesses often try to think and act like already established companies. However, when you grow into a teenager company, what got you to that stage is not the same as what will keep you there. It requires different expectations, along with a more structured and process-driven approach. I had a meal prep company, I opened it in 2016 and sold in late 2021. https://betterdaysbbq.com/

It's a barbecue restaurant! Carry out only. That's how I was able to achieve $2 million in sales running it myself. I had a perfect setup for a one-man show. I was able to cook all my food in a slow smoker overnight and then put it in holding cabinets to keep it warm while I served it off of a steam table during the day. I sold it in '23, shortly after I hit 2 million in sales. Well I have tried that and I can‚Äôt even manage the mangers . Ha, that sounds about right. I can manage a two-week vacation but would not be able to stay away much longer. About 6 months from the launch I needed help with basic things. That person is still with us, and is one of the most valuable teammates You can‚Äôt prevent people from retiring and moving to Florida.  It‚Äôs called heavens door step for a reason. [deleted] My business is at a turning point, I can feel it. Grew up in a similar situation and would love to give this a read. We‚Äôre at $1.2-1.4M with 11 employees and I know the next stage is going to require some significant changes if we want to get there. The plus side for us is that nobody in the industry is really at the next stage yet. The con is there‚Äôs no model or anything even close. i have to agree with u/Bombsquad88 on this. Framework is a big word, yet we don‚Äòt see evidence for either business operations or exceptional parenting - which are the two disciplines you‚Äòre trying to marry.

I agree that many consulting companies presume a certain standard in how an organization should be built and that is mostly too much too early when the company is young. 
On the other hand there are plenty of consultancies that can help small businesses a great deal, but for a more advanced type of business they are simply too unprofessional and too simple.

My personal key takeaway from my MBA was: Heck, none of these people knows shit. So if they don‚Äòt know, probably nobody will know. That‚Äòs when I realized I am on my own and I can achieve a competitive advantage only by hard work and sharp analysis of the individual situation of my company. Not sure if another framework would help ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Absolutely! I've run + sold 3 businesses now, and my number 1 goal is always getting to a state where the system is set so I can focus on feeding it, rather than being reactive to day-to-day ""operations"". Hardware software sales and support organization, and and a SAAS organization. Net 30 Thank you! I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs an adult - but it 100000% can and does run without me, that‚Äôs because of the amazing team. We‚Äôve only been around for 6 or so years and I have no business experience (art degree lol). Maybe it‚Äôs imposter syndrome but I definitely don‚Äôt feel adult yet ü´£. I tried to. I had to fire so many people one year that I now subcontract all my work. But yea it certainly pays the bills and then some. It's also help me to understand which hurdles I'm going to jump with my next endeavors Definitely an adult. Multimillion dollar agency, 18 people, documented processes for everything, most systems automated. My partner and I are not required for day to day work. We focus on the vision for the company and new biz strategies. You're not wrong.  I thought it was a good example and provides context as to when a business stops acting like a small business--it's when your operations management practices have to be revamped to account for scale.  I don't think it's a matter of ""feelings""

One example has to do with our regular courier aspect of operations.  It used to be, I could play courier as needed, or we could play around with who did courier for reasons of cost savings.  The problem with this was that it introduced uncertainty into the process--and that uncertainty cost us. This is legendary stuff. If more entrepreneurs knew about businesses like this instead of just the big giants, they‚Äôd see what I call 'small but mighty. $2m lifetime sales or yearly gross sales? What was transaction price?¬† Congrats! What was your best year? Wondering how many hours you were doing yourself too.  And when you got into the groove how many pounds of meat were you dealing with a day? It seems like you don‚Äôt enjoy dealing with managers. Perhaps you should consider finding someone who can handle that aspect for you. In the meantime, I recommend reading Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman. Teenager transitioning into early adulthood. Yes, I say it all the time, the first hire is the most crucial when your business becomes a toddler. It is essentially like hiring a babysitter, your first employee. If it is a good or bad hire, it can literally make or break the company. I am not surprised that this person remains one of your most valuable teammates to this day. You can read the book and decide for yourself. If managing a business based on its life cycle is so common and obvious, why do so many people fail to do it? I‚Äôd be happy to send you an advanced reader copy

I‚Äôd love to get your feedback and review. Just let me know and let your curiosity guide you! Interesting. Has there been an increase in demand for your product or service? An increase in demand is different from prematurely scaling your operations without it. I‚Äôd be happy to share a copy of the book with you for an early review just send me a DM! Why are we communicating as if we‚Äôre in an MBA program? The two disciplines I‚Äôm trying to merge are not just academic concepts. This isn‚Äôt something I picked up in a classroom. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve learned the hard way through real-life experience. It‚Äôs not just about business operations or exceptional parenting. I‚Äôve developed the trademarked BAAB framework, which I now use in my consulting practice. This framework is bound to evolve as I continue to refine it further.

We need proof and evidence, but maybe we should start looking at evidence from a different perspective, even backwards. Why do they say 9 out of 10 startups fail? If we dig deeper, startups often fail in similar ways to established companies. But how can that be the case when survival itself is a success for a baby business? The issue is that startups are often held to the same expectations as already established companies, which sets them up for failure.

Take Google‚Äôs acquisition of Android as an example. It‚Äôs like a parent adopting another business that‚Äôs at a different stage of maturity, whether it‚Äôs a baby, a toddler, or a teenager. Why do you think large corporations experience so many internal business failures and then turn to acquisitions? What kinds of evidence would you look for to understand this trend?

If you go through my comment section, you‚Äôll notice I can often identify where a business stands just from the way it‚Äôs described. When people explain their businesses clearly, it becomes easier to pinpoint the core issues. Understanding where your business is in its lifecycle makes it simpler to determine which strategies you should be applying at that point.

While I will continue to refine the BAAB framework, my goal is to eventually make it accessible to everyone, including those in academia, who want to analyze it from a scientific perspective. What kind of businesses were they? That is three things at once pretty cool! That is amazing. I mentioned earlier in one of my comment sections that running a business comes down to three fundamental things: building relationships with people, basic knowledge of accounting, and understanding your sales. It sounds like your business is probably an adult. You had the foresight and relationship skills to hire the right people to run the business without you. That takes real skill, especially the ability to maintain strong relationships with them. Great story! Makes sense. My consulting firm actually provides contractors for subcontracts. May I ask which industry you are in? Definitely an Adult, Amazing , the approach dealing with an adult company is different, that is pretty cool üòé. What does your agency do ? It‚Äôs not about feelings, but I mentioned that to highlight the human aspect of business growth, whether it‚Äôs a baby, toddler, teenager, or adult. Your business is actually a separate entity, almost like its own human being, distinct from you. At a certain point it becomes more process driven. Not longer art but a science of what works. Most people won't listen. Somehow they're convinced it's too hard. Quick side note, I live in Rutherford county tennessee. In a city called murfreesboro. To start an at-home business here, let's say window washing, the city business licenses $15. The county business license costs $15. Once you have acquired those, the state business license is free. That's for every business, no matter how big or small. It cost $30 to be in business today, legally, where I live. Lifetime! My average ticket was $20 It‚Äôs not ai don‚Äôt like dealing with managers it‚Äôs just not in my skill set

I have even hired coaches to help me. 

Anyway .

I plan on starting an property investment group within the next year or so but Ive already got a lot of irons in the fire.

I really just orchestrate other companies anymore. Its been a long hard road but quality control was sooo much more of a problem when you do larger scale work.

Great DM me your email and I will share it with you. Started with flipping hats and botting sales, then scaled up to digital marketing. I've used Hootsuite and HubSpot for automating tasks, but Pulse for Reddit can really help streamline Reddit engagement, helping you focus on your main business hustle. I agree with you. In that industry, smaller, more powerful units as subcontractors work better. It makes sense, and everybody wins. Nice üòä WOW!! Unbelievable üòÇ Not much, but I really don't discuss that.

It‚Äôs frustrating how much attention goes to businesses with billion-dollar exits, making entrepreneurs feel like they‚Äôre not achieving enough.

I made an email tool that either instantly replies or drafts responses to all incoming emails using your data. 

This is how it works:
1)  Create an account
2) Upload your data. This can range from website, your pdfs/documents, FAQ‚Ä¶
3) Link the email accounts that you want to have replies drafted/sent from 

And thats abt it! Honestly I see a lot of applications for this tool but this could be particularly useful for:

- small business/people that have unmonitored email accounts (info@, support@..)
-individuals that send a lot of emails per day and want an assistant that helps them draft replies.

My question is would you use this tool?

Thanks! 
","this sounds super useful, especially for small businesses managing multiple inquiries. does it allow for customizing the tone or style of replies? also, how does it handle more complex queries that aren‚Äôt covered by the uploaded data? Definitely interested This is a neat idea and love the pitch ‚Äúchatbot for email‚Äù in one of your comments. I could also see this would gain a lot of traction on producthunt with this pitch and a fair execution of the idea. I really love it actually. Emails seem like the #1 source of customer to business communication. I think you tapped into a perfect opportunity here if noone has already done this?¬†

I would gather as many common potential use cases that people might ask just to get an idea of what sort of responses would be satisfactory to the customers. If you can imagine, some generic automated answers might be frustrating to the customer and might backfire.¬†So maybe also something to think about is transparency with customers - letting them know that the response was auto generated. Definitely interested in something like this. Please keep posting updates! Would use, and interested to hear more I built a similar product for email. I tried selling it on LinkedIn but found it quite hard. Lots of manual process so I decided to pivot and build a similar tool for LinkedIn. Sounds good, I think there's a risk with auto answer. But good that you have draft approval if people want. Did you know there are tools out there doing this ATM? Fyxer is one. Hi! I'm sending you a DM, I know very well an industry that NEEDS such tool, id love to test it! I would use this tool if it could be self hosted. Having worked in public/private and different industries,¬†privacy is a deal breaker.



I'm not sure the people emailing¬†would be impressed their conversations are being sent to a third party.



I like your idea and it touches on a fundamental need; communication is the most important part of any project. Happy to provide any further info if needed. Could this be used for automating the process of sending rejection letters? üòÇ How does this work? Like an autoresponder in every email tool? What do you mean by draft? How does it recognise the topic of the mail and can formulate a sensical answer? Definitely interested in using this tool ! But a question, would that tool send different custom messages to different emails through the excel or it would send the same message to different emails? Also, whats the probability of the email id getting banned due to bulk emails? Hi DM, personally, let‚Äôs have a look at it Sorry about your job situation.   
Regarding the project idea - how does it work, do you use some AI to generate responses? I mean, how can you reply automatically without knowing what people ask you about As an academic and busy mom, it would be very useful tool to have. I own a pottery studio and that'd be so helpful for us! Checking it out We are definitely interested in hearing more. Can you please dm me. For those that use Office365 I feel like Copilot can already do this, albeit with prompts on the emails you actually want to respond to. It already has access to all your previous emails AND all your documents in Teams/One Drive etc what are you going to do about email sending limits? Not fun being in anything related to IT right now. I‚Äôm working on a few ideas, one is an app but need to network to get a developer(s) on board along with specialities in different aspects of the app. 

I just wanted to clarify before answering yours, which sounds like it has great potential: is it for a user and/or business to sign up? The documents being uploaded would then be stored in users account on business end? FAQ to be used to indicate to the code where to place the document, pic, whatever, to the certain location and respond accordingly to what was uploaded? An Email chatbot? God I hate this so much.  Please don't make the world a worse and more frustrating place for people that are reaching out for help!! doesnt this already exist in multiple variations a gazillion times..? Yes, rn I have it match the style of your previous emails obviously there are some tweaks that needs to be done - so if there is no data or if there‚Äôs uncertainty in the response and the tool is used for customer support then it will ""escalate"" the query and notify you. 

if the bot is set to automatically send the replies then it will answer the user that they forwarded their email to a member of the team things of the sort! btw when I say previous emails - you upload your own emails that you want the AI agent to match in tone cause obviously reading/saving any emails would be a disaster in terms of privacy. Hey, yes absolutely!! I actually already implemented this. This is a sample response that was generated in one of demos:

""Hi  X,

Something something something 

If this email was not helpful, please reply with ‚ÄòNOT HELPFUL‚Äô and a representative will assist you.

Best regards,

AI Support Agent"" 

1) if the user replies with NOT HELPFUL or asks to speak to a human in any shape of form the query gets escalated as explained in other comments. sent you a DM Can I send you a dm? Manual Process? in terms of what exactly if you don‚Äôt mind me asking? Do you mean users uploading their data? Haha I don‚Äôt think so it‚Äôs mainly for customer support and it only deals with inbound emails and it‚Äôs being sent from the user/company own email address Answers:


1) it‚Äôs basically a chatbot for email, you have two options either set it up to auto respond to incoming emails or if you want more control you can set it up to only write drafts, meaning it‚Äôll compose an email response but not send it

2) it answers based on your own data that was set up on your dashboard. 

And in general how it‚Äôs generating sensical answers - Each incoming email get fed into a rag pipeline. It can have multiple back and forths while being aware of the context of the thread + there‚Äôs a confidence score threshold. If the answer is not in your data or it‚Äôs not confident abt the answer it‚Äôll escalate for you to handle - it stops replying if reply to a thread or if it got escalated.

Again, idk if it‚Äôs a feasibke business idea, wouldn‚Äôt scale well, but at the very least I hope it can get some gears turning for you. If ur in the USA there are 0 cities that would allow that.

If I'm hiring a tradesman and he comes to me with a resume and retail, pizza guy and delivery driver he's on the bottom of the pile when compared to kids that were mowing lawns and doing their own t",,difficult,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1hzep96/im_13_and_i_want_to_get_a_vending_machine/,I‚Äôm 13 and I want to get a vending machine,I want to get a vending machine with my allowance and my dad says that it would be illegal.,"At 13, I love how you're thinking and it might be a good starter side-hustle. 

I do want to point out that it is by no means a way to get passive income, and scale is only achieved by hiring people to stock the machines. Those you hire will likely make it hard to profit due to paying them. 

Is it a good business model? No.

Is it a good idea for a 13 year old to get their toes wet with the world of entrepreneurship? Absolutely. Howdy. If you're anywhere near Kentucky (cincinnati, Indianapolis, etc) have your parents DM me. 

I'll give you a few small manual machines to get started! I never did this as a business, just have several machines from buying storage.

And good luck! We all start somewhere Hey, a vending machine might sound like a great idea for some passive income, but let me share a few things I learned while helping my parents when they were thinking about buying one.

First, if you place the machine inside a business, you‚Äôll likely need to pay them a commission (let's say 12%). This can eat into your profits. Plus, there‚Äôs always the chance the business owner might decide, ""Hey, this vending machine is making money‚Äîwhy not get my own and keep 100% of the profit?""

Second, keep in mind that if the location is far from where you live, you‚Äôll need reliable transportation to restock it, which might mean a weekly or even twice-weekly trip, depending on demand. This adds time and fuel costs (also, because of your age, you'll depend on someone to drive you there).

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a bad idea‚Äîit can work‚Äîbut it‚Äôs definitely not as easy as it might seem at first. Just a few things to think about before jumping in. Good luck. Just do normal kid work.

Mow lawns. Shovel snow.  Clean yards.

Buy a pressure washer and a car at 16 ramp up.

Buy a pack out kit and tools and do camera setups or underground sprinklers, rototilling and aerating.

Just look around.  If all these other numb nuts like us can do it so can you . OP saw some inst reels or TikTok‚Äôs from these fake financial gurus. Instead of wasting your time with these folks, learn to code and study your ass off to get into a top school. Nice to see kids at 13 asking such questions rather then Tik Tok scrolling 24/7, good luck with any idea you decide to implement They say do what you know, and at your age you probably know what ppl your age would buy from a vending machine. Were you thinking of putting one near your school or something? Why has your dad said no? You know, ‚Äúno‚Äù just means you haven‚Äôt convinced him yet. Make a business plan. Convince him! If it works, you make money, if it fails, you‚Äôll learn a lot along the way for your next venture. Good luck! This could potentially be a profitable idea. However, some of the points raise by the other comments are hurdles you will need to consider.
If however, you were;
1. Able to obtain a quality vending machine (accepting cash and card) for a very good price (could be a problem)
2. Able to keep fixed operating costs down (ideally zero) by;
a) ensuring it‚Äôs located somewhere you transverse daily/ multiple times each week 
b) stocked with items you have a high margin on.

Depending on financial risk/ interest, and the above criteria, might be worth a shot. The easiest thing you can do at your age to make money is probably selling candy at school. Very low price of entry. Buy bulk from Costco, and just make sure it‚Äôs visible to the rest of the students. 

I used to be a hardcore introvert and never really had to do anything when I did this. 

An elective class I was part of had my classmates and I do fundraising. We all got candy to sell. It‚Äôs insane how much candy I sold, even moreso knowing all my classmates were also selling candy. You‚Äôll quickly become know as the kid that‚Äôs selling candy. 

Have your parents open you a Fidelity Youth account. Learn how to save an invest. Fight the urge to spend the money and watch it grow. It grows much larger and faster the longer you fight the urge to spend. Congrats on wanting to start your entrepreneur journey! Your mindset already has you leaps and bounds ahead of most 13 year olds. You could be the candy/snack kid at your school? It‚Äôs easy, fast and I‚Äôve seen people make hundreds a day. Once kids know you got the goods the cafeteria doesn‚Äôt, you‚Äôll be known and it‚Äôll go from there. Just maybe need to keep it on the down low from teachers if they‚Äôre not supportive. Vending machines are tough. There is way more to it than what people think.

For starters, they break all the time. Next, you need locations. Next, you have to carry a lot of inventory, you need multiple machines or ypu will have tons of waste.  Also, you need CC readersin today's day and age, that will set you back some. Etc etc

Source: Owned a vending route with 40 machines while the state and localities may have a problem, let me refer you to one of the books we had as a side project in business school. Not required but highly encouraged: Guerrila marketing. It along with :negotiate like your life depends on it; lead from no; Pivot the only move that matters, and better ( atul gawande). I kickstarted a ten year blitz on leveling up. 
The aufhorities may eventually tell you to get rid of it, possibly. You may argue its for personal use. But should move it once they press. Unless there is an hoa then no not a good idea. 

However, read those books then go talk to businesses and see if you can supply a vending machine. talk only to decision makers but dont underestimate the gatekeepers. get 500 of them to say No. Start back over with each a couple weeks later. Change your pitch and learn to dodge that part that gets the definitive No. ( There is some benefit to getting to No faster, those waste less time). 
No is what you want to become immune to ( in business). Like water on a ducks back. You need to learn conversational pivoting. 
Focus on what does the person need, what are their problems. Think hard about how can you offer something to help.
Pay attention to what you see. ( lots of dress shirts? ) ( cant leave for lunch) (nice cars) 
Offer a service for what you see. print flyers and have your name, what grade and offer errands like dry cleaning pickup/ delivery. to even iron clothes if needed or mow yards, or figure out how to get a wagon and 2 buckets to wash a car and offer service while parked at work. The higher level jobs have one thing in common, exhaustion. go to reddit boards of professions you have offices nearby you and ask what task would they most like done by a kid visiting their office. Is it vo get lunch or maybe theres a grocer nearby. 

but vending is the one where you have to chat with hundreds and hundreds of businesses and most already have something. except for the small mom and pop single owner businesses. 

Buy a cart and find a big business like an aluminimum plant or coca cola plant anything big. sell prepacked food. If it were coca cola I would sell coke very very visibly to them. yeah they get it free, but your age and hustle will be why they will buy off you. Always have a second choice but avoid selling competing products to a place's employees. Be the vending machine.

When I worked at a well known milk and ice cream company we had a guy come by selling ice cream out of a cart with dry ice. we always bought because we knew the work of doing the leg work to hustle. He also had tamales in a warmed cooler. guess what else we bought? One other thing to think about is to list your skills. what do you know how to do? can you play an instrument or do something?
What is your quirk or compulsion? are you an organizer having to have things tidy or are you a million tasks at once type? I ask because a tidy oerson can find people that are overwhelmed by their disorganization and offer a cleanup or even get some gig counting and entering a spreadsheet of data. Or the chaotic person can handle a lot of things and may be a good task orientated business person. 
 
If an instrument, get 5 songs down solid  get the timing right. metronome or click lite. Timing is what makes the beat and mediocre sound good. a small restaurant what their slow night is and ask to play acoustic instrumental those nights. 
Ask to wash their windows the going rate is too high so if reasonable maybe you can get a weekly gig windows or busking. 

Now the task I need a person to do but everyone is asking crazy money for, is a regular picture and post to social media of my food. I understand that the rates out there can be a certain amount. I however have a low volume place.  Sales Conversion on social media posts are low despite what food influencers try to convince everyone of. I would pay a kid a hundred a month to come eat a free meal every week and post on the big three socials. So now look at what you know about social media. and look around at all those small single owner businesses that cant get time to run their social media. It has value but it doesnt drive sales until it is solid and has been going for awhile. 

I wonder what would happen if a 13 year old approached a business and had some canned responses that could be added to every post or review ( a premium service) or just a proposal for a pic every week or day or month captioned and posted to their social media and have a ""trial"" account to show what it could look like if it was on their pages.... Now I wonder how many restaurateurs would be interested. It would be a great side gig to run up to 4 businesses at once  and have plenty of time for school and friends and make some great side money ( get an ITIN, dont use your social security for these side business gigs https://www.irs.gov/tin/itin/how-to-apply-for-an-itin).

Really trustworthy, and I might ok flyering a neighborhood. going rate is about .20 to .50 per house for a company to do it for me. 

what does a business nearby not do as well as the big corporate competitors? offer a reasonable service doing that. 
undercut all the companies that offer that service. 

I would even hire someone to come in once a week/month and deep scrub what daily cleaning misses. Get an owner at the start of the quarter and inspections are on their mind. 
Got an inventory counter? got a deep clean guy? how about nightly or morning drive through hot hose and parking lot pick up? 

Small businesses like mine have very small budgets for extra, but there are things that we will go for if offered at the right time. I may say no a hundred times but there will be once I really need anyone to come by and offer. No is not right now but not always, is no meaning never, at least with business.

What if you flyered menus on cars at school? thats an access to a group I dont have access to. 

I hope you get some ideas. I definitely would never share the above with anyone walking in. But a price list and a solid plan will sit on my desk eating away at me while I work on my daily pain points. 
My pest control guy came by as a new customer, chatted and asked after his meal if I knew others that may need pest service. left a flyer with prices. I had gotten a price increase from truly nolan 3 months later that was now significantly higher than this flyer left for just in case any of my friends needed service. He became my bug guy and pest prevention. Is the best service I have and it is all from doing business with me and a friendly chat. most people cannot sell to me, he didnt go that route and it was what kept the flyer pinned up. Tell your dad it's a vending machine, not a hooker Id suggest getting into website and online biz instead. Develop something learn some skill related to it. I bought one a few years ago at 15 for $500. Messaged multiple businesses asking if they‚Äôd be willing to work with me. All no‚Äôs. There was a few that said yes, but then i realized that the area was not suitable for a vending machine. I think it could make you eh money, about $20-40 a week profit IF it‚Äôs in a good area, but you‚Äôd have to keep it maintained, and make time to go and restock when it‚Äôs out. At your age, there‚Äôs better hustles you could do with the money you have to buy the machine. If you want any help with any hustles or anything message me and i‚Äôll help a fellow teen outü§ô Your mindset will get you far in life, never stop with the entrepreneurship. A vending machine is a fantastic way to start earning! It sells for you 24/7 and is easy to service. Personally I did candy vending (gumball machines) and lived on the profits for several years before I sold the business and moved on. Great place to start your journey to making millions. why do you want to get a vending machine? Not a judgement question, I'm legitimately interested in your answer. @goodthingsvending for inspo You'll need a trailer and a vehicle to tow it. You'll also need to be a hardware/software wizard. Restock it. etc. etc.

  


Too much to bite off at 13 without serious help. Ok is there something else I could do Tbh I was going to put it on the front yard because there‚Äôs a park nearby Here‚Äôs the thing, bc this sounded exactly like me at a young age. Don‚Äôt listen to these people say to get a normal job. You are 13 and you have a brain and internet, try your best to get started. Even if it fails you learn so much at that age and early too. My dad said the same thing and really suffered for like 8 years bc now it was engrained in my head that I have to have a ‚Äúnormal job‚Äù. People are wired differently and you can‚Äôt ever require that really. I say go for it OP! I don‚Äôt think im old enough to buy a car Alright thank you OP said after the intention was to place it in the front yard, where a park is nearby. Seems like some good money to make during school You be the vending machine. Buy a candy in bulk thats popular in school and sell them individually in school/on the bus. Wont make you rich but is a good little hustle to start with. 100% but I'm not here to tell you what it is. I think at your age a vending machine is a good idea. 

My first business was in college. I made custom clothes, threw ""drop parties"" and sold them to college kids. Made a small killing. 

I'm a big believer that entrepreneurship is a skill that can be trained over time, you need success and you need failure. 

Don't worry about getting an awesome business model on your first go. Just try to do anything at all and turn a profit. 

Keep your financial investment to a minimum and realize that 80% of businesses fail in 5 years. 

Start small, slowly get riskier and play with bigger numbers as you get older and gain more experience. Depends how much money you want. Hundreds, thousands, millions? Random idea I had a while back and I have no idea if this would actually work, and there probably wouldn‚Äôt be much volume for it but I figure it‚Äôs worth a mention to dip your toes in the water or to at the very least get the gears in you head turning. 


You ever see a newer or newerish vehicle with damaged paint and the metal is starting to rust? Buy a cordless drill, a metal brush attachment (or a regular wire brush if you‚Äôre not allowed to use power tools), safety glasses (VERY IMPORTANT), and some of those touch up pens for car paint. Get some flyers made and walk around the Walmart parking lot and put them under the wiper blades of cars that look like they could use this service. 


Use the drill with the brush attachment or metal bristle hand brush to get rid of the rust and use the touch up pen once the rust is gone. You would need different size brushes. You don‚Äôt want to show up to do a job with a 1 inch brush and the rust spot is a quarter of an inch. 

You could probably charge $25-$50 for this. Being 13 may make this difficult due to not being able to drive. Again, idk if it‚Äôs a feasibke business idea, wouldn‚Äôt scale well, but at the very least I hope it can get some gears turning for you. If ur in the USA there are 0 cities that would allow that. Might need a permit It's true now more than ever.

If I'm hiring a tradesman and he comes to me with a resume and retail, pizza guy and delivery driver he's on the bottom of the pile when compared to kids that were mowing lawns and doing their own thing on their own time.

A regular job is often bad experience. But at 16 you will be.  Like I said.

I was laying out the long term. Very good advice there ! 
Crunch the numbers, you may end up realizing one of two things.

1. It's actually not going to be profitable; in which case, it's not a loss, you learned something and you can move on to moving to a new idea or perfect this  one.

2. It's indeed going to be profitable (presumably), in which case you have a good case to present to your dad or whoever ends up accompanying you The hooker? Is there a market for this in your area? Are there competing vendors around? Where would you put it? What laws or regulations did your father cite for it being illegal? Do you know about maintenance and restocking? What would you stock it with? Do you know where to find access to suppliers? This is the answer. At 13, in high school, it would be more worthwhile figuring out a way to get an empty locker and pre-sell or arrange to sell high demand items (whatever that may be, Mr Beast chocolate bars or Prime? I dunno what‚Äôs cool these days..). Keep cash separate from locker (do Venmo or other e-transfer if it is possible within that age-group), and only bring what you expect to sell each day to stock locker. Expect someone to break in to locker and steal at some point - hence the above advice. My 14 yo kid does this with chocolate chip cookies! He bakes up a batch, brings them to school. ‚ÄúGifts‚Äù one to the teacher and sells a few dozen. Good lord it‚Äôs like he a little dealer! Paying off the ‚Äúcops‚Äù with free samples! And I guess I could do this with soda and a cooler Hundreds I‚Äôm an impulse buyer Ok Alright While the responder may be right in theory, people make money through hundreds of activities when implemented correctly, and this would be an excellent way to begin in business as a young person.

Have a look for vending machines on Alibaba and Temu.

The other side of the equation is finding people who are happy for you to have a vending machine at their premises. They will want to know what goods you will be stocking etc. 

For every business somebody has an idea. There will be many people telling them not to do it. Go for gold and what you would like to do. I planed to place it at the front yard because there‚Äôs a park nearby and a lot of people run by Your state likely has licensing and zoning requirements. You can‚Äôt just put a vending machine in your front yard. Keep pushing though, you will figure something out. Or they can try and see how long till someone complains.",2025-01-11 23:25:23

Unestablished musicians who aren‚Äôt household names already, barely make anything through streaming or YouTube. And I assume established musicians would always be in favor of earning more.

Having a non profit streaming service without the legal obligation to increase shareholder value whenever possible, would enable ( I‚Äôm assuming) the organization to pay out considerably more to artists. As well as employees of the organization. The problem is expansion.. Besides charging a monthly fee to consumers that ‚Äúmight‚Äù cover employee salary and operating expenses. How do you expand without additional revenue?

Besides accepting donations for more revenue, Is there a way for this hypothetical organization to offer something ‚Äústock-like‚Äù to the public, that could offer something in the way of a dividend? These ‚Äúshares‚Äù would not be able to be traded, sold or put on any kind of exchange. ‚ÄúShare holders‚Äù would have no say, vote, or input on organization decisions or policies. And funds would not benefit any employee in the organization monetarily. They would strictly be used for additional servers/procurement/overhead, + additional human resources. Is there some way to do something like this?","You can structure anything you want if you have good lawyers. But overly complex creates confusion and doesn't stand the test of time. 

See OpenAI I‚Äôd recommend that you first understand how the industry and existing players work.¬†

Spotify is public so you can read their annual filings and learn a ton about their ops. They are massive and still not profitable.

They pay ~70% of the revenues to labels for licensing rights. Artists don‚Äôt get paid a lot not because streaming services are stingy, but because their music rights are owned by the label and artists themselves get maybe 10% of the royalties labels collect.

The other problem you‚Äôll have to solve is how to get enough listeners - Spotify needs to have rights to almost the entire music catalog to even have the right to compete for a customer. You won‚Äôt be using a service (much less pay for it) if it doesn‚Äôt have the music you want to listen to.

My surface level understanding is that cost ‚Äúper stream‚Äù is very low because Spotify doesn‚Äôt charge per stream, they make most of their money from premiums and that‚Äôs a fixed amount each month. So if today smaller artists don‚Äôt get much from Spotify without a label in between - that‚Äôs probably because people don‚Äôt stream their music much. If they wanted to 10x payouts to everyone they‚Äôd need to nearly 10x what they charge users. But then their user base would shrink dramatically, and they‚Äôd make less money in total > less payouts to artists.¬†

The problem you need to solve is not about which legal form of the company to choose. Thanks for the thoughtful response. You‚Äôre absolutely right. The record companies/music publishing are the primary barrier to fair artist compensation. Notorious for screwing over musicians. Another huge problem are unnecessary 3rd party middlemen like Ticketmaster who nickel and dime both sides and ridiculously ratchet up ticket prices. I guess a better Idea would be a not for profit record company first, or a niche market streaming service targeted new and emerging artists that could double as both a label and a streaming platform. 
I don‚Äôt know I just spontaneously had this idea trying to contemplate how musicians could earn more via not for profit. It would take millions to get it off the ground. 

But what about the alternative ‚Äúshares‚Äù idea just in general for nfpo? Is that possible? Well, the question re: shares is where are the funds to pay the dividends coming from? Dividends are a way of distributing a company's profits to the owners. But a Not-For-Profit by definition wouldn't have any profits to distribute.

If you issue more shares to raise funds to pay dividends, you've got yourself a ponzi scheme.

If you increase monthly subscription prices to generate earnings to pay dividends, then you're just a private for-profit company that issues non-voting preferred shares.

If you never actually pay out dividends on the shares, then the funds received when issuing the shares were essentially just donations. They wouldn‚Äôt be owners of anything though. Not for profits can profit as long as the profits are reinvested back directly in the org itself to grow the org. But yeah figuring out a creative way to offer a financial vehicle from the company to the general public is a big hurdle and most likely illegal. I‚Äôm just trying to figure out a way musicians can be musicians, without a ramen noodle diet and sleeping in a van. I think then the question becomes, what are you offering that would make people want to buy these financial vehicles? They would get a quarterly cut lol ‚Äúlike a dividend‚Äù all proceeds of the pseudo share go towards operating costs and expansion. They wouldn‚Äôt be personally financially benefiting any employee at the org. Maybe I could call them ‚Äúmembership certificates‚Äù and any funds dispersed back to members could be called ‚Äúnon guaranteed donations‚Äù lol. I‚Äôm probably dreaming, and this isn‚Äôt legal or feasible. Lol yeah I know how dividends work. I'm saying, why would an investor choose to partake in something that doesn't provide ownership (equity) or guarantee of principal (debt). If you're relying on goodwill, wouldn't donations be much simpler?

Realistically, the administrative costs of issuing proprietary financial instruments would be prohibitive. Primarily because they would want to advocate the idea of supporting fair pay for artists and have the possibility to get a little something in return. It would be an investment for music fans mostly. If it were to be successful perhaps it would become popular outside of that sphere. It would kind of be like a 2 way patreon. Instead of supplemental content it would be money. You are contradicting yourself.¬†

If you are planning to sell shares but then issue profit sharing rights (like a dividend), then there is a lot of problems with this:
1) You can‚Äôt do this in a nonprofit legal form (you can‚Äôt distribute profits). But also in terms of accounting - financing raised does now flow through P&L so it‚Äôs not technically ‚Äúprofits‚Äù, then you should go straight to point 2.
2) If your source of income is people buying shares, so that you pay musicians AND the people who bought shares earlier - it‚Äôs a Ponzi scheme with extra steps. And is illegal.
3) You will need to continue raising money to ensure continuity of payouts: will you be issuing more shares for that? Who will buy them? The old shareholders or new ones? If new - you‚Äôll eventually run out of people willing to buy and again you can‚Äôt do that because it‚Äôs illegal. If old - why would they pay you money again? Why not cut out the middle man and all the admin and transaction fees and just raise less money to begin with (share price - dividend)? But then you end up running a charity.

In general, from the perspective of a shareholder, getting ‚Äúshares‚Äù in return that have no ownership or voting rights or any other benefit attached to them does not constitute ‚Äúgetting something‚Äù in return. You don‚Äôt need shareholders, you need charitable donors. So¬†What you‚Äôre describing is not a business model, it‚Äôs a charity.

The problem you have to solve is - how to realistically make enough money to achieve your goal of paying musicians more? Is there a commercial offer so good, that you‚Äôll have customers willing to buy from you repeatedly? And here I have to again recommend that you study how the industry works now - Spotify pays out 70% of the money they make to musicians. This is a cost of goods sold that is ridiculously high. You can barely survive it with sufficient scale.¬†

The question is - how much do small artists make now on Spotify? How much more do you want to pay them? 10x? 100x? Will you find customers who are willing to pay 10-100x of what a Spotify subscription costs them to support small artists? This is what I mean by ‚Äúyou need to find a viable commercial offer that achieves what you‚Äôre set to achieve‚Äù.

Also note that most nonprofits actually do have an underlying very profitable business with a massive customer base and good commercial offer. Famously, IKEA, Rolex and most universities are / or are owned by nonprofits.

P.S. I don‚Äôt mean to sound discouraging, but I see a lot of gaps in financial knowledge and commercial understanding in your messages. This is okay since you have never done it before. I am an investor and work in a field where the two overlap. I recommend that you focus on figuring out the commercial side (what to sell, who will buy it, how will we make money) and for now assume that there are no financial and legal loopholes at all. The system is designed quite efficiently to avoid the obvious abuse.",2025-01-11 18:19:11

For backstory, I‚Äôm 20 and work on a Ranch. I own a 6x10 dump trailer and also do junk removal on the weekends. 

I‚Äôm looking to grow into land management. 
I would offer things like
-tree removal 
-agriculture fencing 
-bush hogging 
-brush and vegetation clearing 
-storm debris clearing
-fence line clearing 

For anyone who maybe knows a little about this space, what else should I add or try to do? 
The reason I came up with this idea is because of my ranch job. I already do half of this, just under an employer. (My grandma) ","Depends where you‚Äôre at, but people just need overall junk removal from where I‚Äôm from. 

When moving out of houses they have a lot of garbage. Maybe connect yourself with moving companies or real estate people that know people who want to move. Just an idea to throw in. U have a good list already.  Whenever u do business for a client, be sure u mention everything else that u do and always suggest another job at the end of another one.  Ex - u are removing junk from a garage and also notice customer has a broken fence, brush area that needs cleared out, dead trees, etc

Thank them for the business on the clean out and mention ‚Äúhey - if you dead tree removed or brush piles cleaned up, or field cleared, let me know.  I do that too.‚Äù

U always want to plant seeds in customer‚Äôs heads.

In my twenties I experienced a brain injury I‚Äôm still recovering from. It was caused by other humans but I‚Äôve never received compensation.

I lost my job, ability to work properly, home, life and spent many years housebound. 

I fought 2 years for disability benefit and finally got it. That is my income. I am grateful for it but it‚Äôs not exactly enough to live on and enjoy life on. Not to mention the desire to have therapy and specialist healing support - which I can‚Äôt yet afford privately.

I am hard working, relatively capable and smart and creative. 

I want to start building secure income in a way that doesn‚Äôt impact my health, but allows me to scale and get to a point where I can 1. Come off disability, 2. Pay for medical support, 3. Create a lifestyle worth living again, 4. Start investing to build a proper future.

I also want to freeze my eggs this year too whilst I still can - so I still have the possibility of having children (again - finances dependent). This will cost thousands to freeze them.

I feel like we live in a time with so much opportunity in our hands (phones/laptops) but I also just feel overwhelmed with all the possibilities and can‚Äôt just throw thousands at this idea or that.

Any thoughts on this is really appreciated. Maybe someone has rebuilt their life from scratch too - would love to hear stories like that

Thank you

EDIT: thank you for all the kind and helpful suggestions I really appreciate it

EDIT 2: I am spending a large portion of my time working on a documentary film about said injury as it‚Äôs an issue that affects millions around the world. Not fully in production yet (do have a short) but already it‚Äôs started created partnerships and I‚Äôve had people message saying they feel hope again in their lives due to the film. That‚Äôs all to say - I want to build revenue alongside that. The film may make ROI but is not my main reason for doing it, whereas it‚Äôs time to also bolster my own security. Likewise, I can‚Äôt drop or pause the film for risk of losing the momentum I‚Äôve worked hard to build so far.","I'm in a somewhat similar situation but in order to give you any advice or ideas we need to know your interests, strengths, weaknesses, skills, and limitations. That sucks you have to go through this. I was earning $250,000/year as a business owner when I got hospitalized for 5 years, due to a mental illness and ended up losing everything from friends to money. I hit rock bottom 2 years ago, launched a pet food ecommerce store and got $3500 in sales within the first 4 months. I faced a lot of backlash from my own family and was forced to shut down that business. I turned 40 last year!

You mentioned that ecommerce is something that you are interested in. Have you thought about creating a shopify store? Its pretty easy to get started. There are very successful art businesses online.

Let me know your thoughts and doubts. I‚Äôll try to assuage them. 

You are in a great place right now even though it may not seem like it. You have the freedom to brainstorm a great biz idea and validate before selling online! I know this is pretty basic stuff, but building a business is like a sinkhole and a huge gamble when you don‚Äôt have much experience. Yeah, there are rare cases where someone makes it on their first try, but most people don‚Äôt. So, given where you‚Äôre at, I‚Äôd say steer clear of whatever ‚Äúguru‚Äù is out there telling you it‚Äôs easy if you just follow their step-by-step program. That‚Äôs probably gonna fail, and that‚Äôs okay because failure is part of it. Most of the time, you either fail or break even if you‚Äôre lucky. What you should do is offer a service you‚Äôre good at or find something you can make at home, then replicate and scale that slowly. Don‚Äôt rush; no matter how old you are, **you still have time**!

Good Luck üëç Watch and learn from Alex Hormozi's videos. Maximize your profits and success with whatever you end up pursuing.

GOOD LUCK! Hey I just want to offer some encouragement and good vibes. I think this post is really admirable  and I wish you the best. Good luck! Wishing you luck on this journey! It‚Äôs hard but rewarding. Like someone else mentioned it‚Äôs mostly going to be decided by your skills and what you like to do and are good at.

Only tip I have is to spend time learning how to sell yourself. Your product, your service, etc will be more successful if you take time to work on your communication skills and how you present yourself. Could be worth exploring now while you recover and consider the type of work you want to do. Learn bookkeeping and how to scale a bookkeeping agency¬† props to you for even thinking about rebuilding like this, it‚Äôs not easy, and you‚Äôve already come so far.

For starting income, maybe look into something low-cost to start, like freelancing (writing, design, admin work) or selling something digital (ebooks, templates, etc.). It‚Äôs scalable and flexible, so it won‚Äôt drain your health.

As for feeling overwhelmed, pick *one* idea and go small at first. Test it out without huge investments. That way, you can see what works before going all in. Not sure if egg freezing is going to be an option. if disability is all you're getting. I feel like the business is definitely the way to go with AI here and begining to replace jobs. 

  
As a software engineer, I'm trying to build a lil side hustle to replace my job as well. Have you considered launching into business partnership with an already existing business? Something with support and guidance the whole way, low startup and the ability to scale it as big as you want. Getting overwhelmed is natural, i get you. If i had to give you one piece of advice, pick up that one skill that you are great at or one thing you enjoy doing so much that you would do it for free and make a business out of it. Without reading this whole thing perhaps a good idea would be to blog about all of this and eventually monetize it. Thank you.

Interests
- love trading and almost became wealthy from it but black swan event of Ukraine war crashed the earnings. Need higher income to play that game again
- quite like creating social media content but very time consuming
- like idea of running online shop (maybe art, just not sure if it‚Äôll be successful enough)
- would like something scalable where I can at some point grow a small team

Limitations
- still dealing with symptoms that would make it hard to at this stage, show up consistently for meetings at a set time 
- not really any capital to invest up front (¬£200-¬£500 max) you could maybe look into getting leads for businesses in Upwork? people tend to pay good money for that and there‚Äôs a big demand for it.

also career growth in marketing can be both challenging and rewarding.

a few tips that have helped me: specialise in a niche area like content strategy or analytics to stand out, stay updated on trends (I watch a lot of YouTube videos to learn and read¬†[trends.co](https://trends.co/)¬†($300/year) and¬†[theadvault.co.uk](https://theadvault.co.uk/)¬†(free) religiously), and get comfortable with analytics, knowing how to measure and interpret results is key.

also, networking with other marketers has been invaluable for learning and staying connected in the industry.

hope this helps, you can do it What an amazing story üëè 

Did you end up sticking with e-commerce? Hey, thank you so much. So sorry to hear you‚Äôve been through a similar thing. How are you doing now? I‚Äôve struggled with my family too. Had I not listened to certain advice I‚Äôd be up ¬£250k, maybe more also. Sometimes solitude (a bit) and trusting your own gut is the way. I have thought about shopify, I think I just haven‚Äôt known enough about it / felt confident in trusting it? But I will look into it more after reading this! Would love to have a decent online shop that I can then create social media ads for and just gradually build that system up. Something I can do on the laptop, monitor on phone and it‚Äôs flexible enough not to hinder health recovery Thank you for the encouragement! Yeah I‚Äôm learning to go with my gut and choose something that at the very least won‚Äôt feel like time wasted because I enjoy it / learn from it Thank you, I do watch his and Leila‚Äôs content actually. Guess their advice hasn‚Äôt turned actionable for me yet but will keep that in mind Ah thank you so much!! Sending good vibes right back at you ‚úåÔ∏è Thank you - great advice. So I do actually communicate regularly via social media content that‚Äôs part of a film I‚Äôm working on (about the above issue). I‚Äôm ok at communication - it‚Äôs just learning the social media, marketing, revenue-building game that‚Äôs key I guess. Being British I‚Äôm also not fullllly comfortable with ‚Äúselling myself‚Äù though I know it‚Äôs important in business. For clarity - looking to monetise / scale something alongside the film work to build my security as I go and be my own investor in the film if needed. Thanks for suggesting, not something that appeals for some reason but appreciate the idea :) Thank you - this is where I‚Äôve got to in my head too. I have loads of little ideas for writing, digital designs, shop ideas etc it‚Äôs just the actual knowing how to 1. Choose which one to try, and then which next one to try if applicable and 2. How to effectively test them without throwing away money Yep, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm wanting to make money and scale a business - so it is an option. I figure I maybe have a 2-4 year window. Good luck with the side hustle venture too Ooo interesting. How would that work though? What benefit would they get from someone lower down the ladder so to speak? Thank you - great advice ‚ò∫Ô∏è I have thought about that, just unsure if it‚Äôs the best way to scale income. Obviously it‚Äôs not ALL about the money but given the time window for the egg freezing in particular I do want to find something that is 80-90% likely to start generating scalable income fairly soon. I‚Äôm just not sure if the blogging market is too saturated? Would love to be proven wrong / find a business model for blogging that ticks off the goals. I do like writing- and the above story is only a 5% fraction of what‚Äôs actually happened. It‚Äôs an issue that‚Äôs affecting 100s of millions worldwide so there is a community for this you know you have all the skillset for product creation, you could make a huge one if you really are creative, and have good problem-solving technics.

  
you know I was about to write an ebook or more of an instruction manual about how to go from A to Z in making a product and I believe you would benefit from it since you do have the skill to do it.

you really motivated me to finish it faster and I'll send you a copy of it completely on me as a thank-you gift for the motivation.

  
and hope you become a millionaire out of it because that would be a kick-ass story.

and you'll build a really good personal brand with this kind of story and mindset you have.

  
stay on it, and I'll try to finish it as fast as humanly possible to help you with it. Learn programming. Create plug ins, add ons, themes, etc. Read Rob Walling's free eBook on that. After a while you might buy and improve such projects. Then sell or hold. The same is possible with websites and domains. 

You could do a mix of own projects and working for others. 

Just one idea. Ah this is really helpful - thank you!! Yeah I‚Äôm more drawn to the creative side (strategy v analytics) but more than happy to roll my sleeves up and understand basics to get things going - then niche up, and hopefully be in a position to outsource / hire on the analytics side from there. Rinse / repeat. Thank you for the links :) Thank you! Yes, I am experimenting with other forms of ecommerce now from fba to dropshipping and private label products and overseas businesses. Lots of failures but I‚Äôm learning a ton of what works and what doesn‚Äôt and which items are scams lol. You need to radically change the way you think. Praying for you. I know God got you, we see it through the disability income! One example of a business model like this is big-scale network marketing. Have you heard of it? 

Essentially you would be launching into business partnership, but as your own business. It‚Äôs a people-to-people duplicatable business model. In my opinion, it‚Äôs extremely effective and allows you a lean start (low cost) and scale with equal and unrestricted opportunity. The ‚Äòbigger fish‚Äô or your ‚Äòupline‚Äô benefit from you building business so they support and help you build. Doesn‚Äôt require selling products (but has the option to) and you get to help people in the process of creating cashflow. It‚Äôs a win-win scenario which isn‚Äôt common in today world! Ah thank you!! What a lovely comment. Yeah I‚Äôm a creator in general - I make art, write music and am working on a film about all the above. So creating a product does definitely appeal. Let‚Äôs stay in touch - wishing you all the motivation and productivity - can‚Äôt wait to see how the book develops! Thanks. Yeah programming has definitely interested me before I think it‚Äôs just the patience factor (ie I know I can create a painting today - and boom, product, whereas retraining obviously would take 6mon-years of focussed effort. I should‚Äôve said in original post that I‚Äôm working on a documentary so don‚Äôt have all the time, rather looking for something to scale alongside (and ideally to a point where I can be my own film investor).

I am fascinated with blockchain though so it still bubbles away as a possibility in my mind Oh and yes domains - I hold a portfolio of around 80. Some really good ones. A few .ai ones too. I need to sell them it‚Äôs just the how, any suggestions for that? Not sure if just putting them on godaddy or sedo auctions is enough - feel like it‚Äôll take active work to reach out to companies? But maybe that‚Äôs the answer for now No problem, glad to help! If you're into the creative side then maybe you could create the ad design for B2B's? Just a thought. This is great to hear. I was thinking about forming a little group of entrepreneurs to connect with / stay accountable with (someone suggested it too on here actually). If that would be of interest? ? Thank you so much xx Brilliant! send me a DM so i don't lose you, whenever it's ready I'll send you a copy. There was a startup that tried to convince women to use egg freezing in a low barrier way. They would get a commission from the egg freezing clinics. They failed because the conversion rate was too low but as a one woman show this might be sustainable? Idk Definitely You have to find something and be consistent. That's the only way to secure an income. Not being inconsistent. You literally posted online asking for different perspectives, but engage like you are already on your path and don't need to make any changes Learn something and build a practice around it. Like refusing to change is just going to keep you in your struggle. 
You don't have to spends thousands to learn something. It's free. 
You could create tiny films for people.
Your mentality is just excuses.
You could create a series around people instead of one documentary. Create an on going organization that helps people with your injury. There's so many ways to help people and make money. You need to look at your documentary and evolve it to content that you can ship fast. Let's the long term documentary still be the goal, but create an organization around helping victims, not being one. Not really sure why the post deserves this negativity but in response‚Ä¶I posted this because of the fact I‚Äôm aware I need to pick 1 thing for scaleable income. That is literally the purpose of posting this. I have been building and crafting for years, whilst recovering from a brain injury. I‚Äôm fully aware focus is now key. I am going through a scoping and brainstorming phase, with some great ideas suggested in this post that I can then narrow down from. I am looking to make an informed choice so I feel confident and focussed in that decision. Explaining an idea or suggestion isn‚Äôt for me is, um, normal? To your point..I can‚Äôt pick everything. You have read a 2min post of mine and have decided my entire mindset in life needs changing. It‚Äôs a bit unnecessary to say the least. Once again thank you for your suggestion. You should find ways to make money off making your documentary and both things will happen. I am doing exactly that, but thought it was sensible to explore a standalone income avenue as part of the financing plan alongside standard film financing (and to boost my own security and ability to invest in my health - which will allow me function better for the film). Nah, your making too many excuses it's really silly. Oh man. I really hope whatever‚Äôs going on in your life works itself out and you find some kind of peace.",2025-01-11 15:02:20

I am in a bit of a pickle, I have found a passion that I love to do, I can do for hours, and it fuels me to do so! I have taken up Front End Web Development and gotten a certification for it from one of those online bootcamps. I am also currently in college for Information Technology. Though my passion is mainly the development of webpages.

I want to know the best way to get clients to make some money from my passion right now. I have a portfolio to show to people, and I've posted on subreddits like r/slavelabour to see if anyone there would be interested in my services but have not had luck, nor on Fiverr either.

So I ask how would I best obtain paying clientel?","I know a web developer in my area. She pulls big clients. Like $40,000 websites on top of SEO management and social media/blog posts. 

Here‚Äôs a few ideas for you. 
Cold call businesses, realtors, and other self-employed professionals. If you search for someone you need the out reach to look up if they have a website and if they do run an SEO audit on it. 

The best way to sell to someone is by solving a problem for them. 
If they are having a hard time getting clients 
Then maybe there website isn‚Äôt reaching enough people. Which means you need to say ‚Äúyour website needs a boost in SEO and here‚Äôs what I can do for you‚Ä¶‚Äù 
Basically connecting the dots between the problem and your solution. 

Find the problem they have, create a solution based on your service model, then pitch it to the client and close the deal. Provide them with the solution. Get on TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram. I over 400k followers and it transformed my business. Best of luck. Customers who ‚Äúwant a website‚Äù are misinformed. A website is useless these days. What they actually need is web traffic. The site is only part of the solution. You actually have the same problem. Refocus your efforts to learn digital marketing, that‚Äôs what you need to learn to run this as a business, and you need practical experience to offer you customer. 
If you can‚Äôt win your own work you will eventually go bust or end up working for someone who can win the work. hey there! as someone who's been down this exact road, let me share what actually worked for me vs what everyone says should work

first off - forget fiverr for now. its so oversaturated with devs that you'll spend more time competing on price than actually building anything worthwhile

here's what i'd recommend (and what i wish someone told me when i started):  
  
start local. seriously. small businesses in your area probably have terrible websites that look like they're from 2005. hit up local facebook groups, chamber of commerce meetings (yeah i know, sounds boring but trust me), and even just walk into places. local businesses are way less likely to ghost you than random internet clients.   
dont market yourself as a ""web developer"" - market yourself as someone who helps businesses get more customers online. small business owners don't care about react or css, they care about result  
last, pick a niche. like seriously. when i started focusing just on restaurants and bars, my conversion rate went wayyy up. became the ""restaurant website guy"" in my area

good luck my friend! Step 1: Create 5-generic website fronts that you can use as a demo/portfolio. Pick 5 hot niches like Plumbing, Real Estate, Marketing Agency, Coffee Store, Grocery Store etc.
Step 2: Go to subreddits of the niches that you created sites for and look for the posts where people are asking for advice, or have a problem with their site. I am quite sure I have seen atleast 3 posts in last 48 hours where people were asking for website help.
Step 3: Engage with their posts, offer them a solution in comments and hit them in dm if they need help in implementation.
Do this for 7-days consistently and you will win clients.

A shortcut to implement this playbook will be to use a tool like hearfluence.com that does it on autopilot and sends you super specific and relevant posts every hour or frequency of your choosing and it has free plan.

Alternate way, look on google for your local businesses and reach out to the ones with crappy sites that you can improve and offer at minimal price and small recurring maintenance fee. Local small businesses could be an untapped goldmine! Many lack an online presence and don‚Äôt even know where to start. You‚Äôre not just selling a website‚Äîyou‚Äôre offering a bridge that connects them with their audience where it matters most: online.

Attention is the new currency, and today‚Äôs marketplace thrives on it. People‚Äôs attention is locked onto their devices, and your services can help local businesses capture that attention. By showing business owners how your expertise can amplify their visibility, you‚Äôre not just building websites‚Äîyou‚Äôre creating opportunities for growth and transformation.

Focus on selling the *outcome*‚Äîthe solution to their problem‚Äînot just the tool you‚Äôre using to solve it. And don‚Äôt shy away from trading services for testimonials or bartering for things you‚Äôd spend the profits on anyway. It‚Äôs all about creating mutual value and building trust as you grow.

They are really useful. Read ""The Cold Start Problem"" by Andrew Chen. Ask everyone you know if there's ANYONE they know who could be interested in your services. Friends, family, neighbors, old people you used to know from school, literally everyone. Obviously start by asking how they're doing, and offer to do it for free to maximize your chances.   
With that, you can start building a portfolio of at least one project you did professionally.  
And with the positive returns from the business you helped, you can convince new people to pay you for the quality of your services.

Basically, get some social proof. You could also get it with videos on social media... start local! reach out to small businesses with outdated sites and offer upgrades. share your portfolio on linkedin, and try platforms like upwork for better gigs than fiverr. Find a client you are hoping to work with, mock up and page or two of what their improved website could look like (with your magical touch, maybe a figma mockup or so) and reach out about all of the amazing things you can do to improve their website with (hopefully) some convincing data points about how your services will increase their business/sales/revenue/etc. 
That allows them to ‚Äúsee‚Äù what‚Äôs next, rather than just trying to imagine it. Did 2 recent 2 videos on this.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=B-MoTa3IzvU Heh, I'll be your client. My business really needs a run-of-the-mill landing page website that doesn't look like hot trash. With just the basics, contact, terms of service, privacy policy, landing homepage. Congrats on finding something you‚Äôre passionate about‚Äîit‚Äôs huge to know what you love doing, especially in something as useful as web development.

Posting on r/slavelabour and Fiverr is a decent start, but those places can be rough if you‚Äôre trying to make real money. Most people there are looking for cheap labor, and it‚Äôs hard to stand out unless you already have tons of reviews. Instead, try targeting small businesses directly. Look around your area for local businesses with outdated websites (or no site at all) and reach out to them. Email works, but honestly, even stopping by in person can sometimes land you a gig. Just explain how you can help their business look better and get more customers online.

Another solid move is to get on Facebook groups or LinkedIn groups for small business owners. These are gold mines for finding people who need help but don‚Äôt know where to look. Introduce yourself, share a few examples of your work, and let people know you‚Äôre available for projects.

Make sure your portfolio isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúlook at this cool design I did.‚Äù Show how your work solves problems. Like, did you redesign a site and help a business get more customers or look more professional? Break it down so potential clients can see what‚Äôs in it for them.

Once you land one or two clients and do a killer job, ask them for referrals. Word of mouth is still one of the best ways to build your client base. Stay consistent, keep improving, and the clients will come. You‚Äôve got this! Is it so wrong that my mind went immediately into the gutter when I read ""paying clientele""?¬†


If I didn't know any better this sounds like undercover talk for some type of escort services... I highly recommend Alex Hormozi‚Äôs books. They sure helped me when starting with my first offers. What you know pales in comparison to who you know. Leverage your network. This is the sales side of business.  It‚Äôs not something schools teach.

It‚Äôs a lot of work and it takes a lot of time.  As far as building websites, there‚Äôs thousands of people shopping daily on fiverr and upwork.  And even reddit. May be keep a presence in Upwork and fiverr as an agency ? At least people can reach out to you, if they like your portfolio. do you consider only self-employment or also finding some job in IT? Hi there! Front-end development is a great skill to have. For getting clients, I'd suggest shifting focus from platforms like Fiverr where there's tons of competition to places where you can build real relationships.

LinkedIn has worked incredibly well for me. Start by optimizing your profile to clearly show what problems you solve (e.g., ""I help small businesses modernize their web presence""). Then engage with potential clients by:

1. Following and commenting on posts 
2. Sharing before/after examples of your work
3. Reaching out with personalized connection requests

Another approach is focusing on a specific niche - like real estate agents or restaurants. They often need similar solutions, which lets you get really efficient at delivering value.

I teach this exact process to other freelancers in Growth Rebel. Happy to share some tips on messaging that works - just DM me.

The key is showing potential clients how you'll solve their specific problems rather than just listing your skills. Once you nail that messaging, getting clients becomes much easier. Monetizing a passion is everybody's dream! Besides the tips they gave below, you can also do hot lead outreach and monitor online social communities to find people that are already looking for your product. To say, right now you're asking how to get clients, somebody else could be asking for recommendations for front end web developers, just like that. You can do it manually or save time and use tools like devi ai to monitor for you and get alerts :) Good luck! This channel has some good sales and marketing content¬†
https://m.youtube.com/channel/UC1zJ4ArnewGAcsmvZAQDVRA You can try this web design lead generation platform called [Webleadr](https://webleadr.com). You can even get any type of businesses without websites from any location you want. It comes with more nifty features of course. Make sure you can a decent portfolio website to showcase your work though. What customer research have you done? You might be fixing a problem, but you need to find who would pay to have that problem fixed. That way your effort is focused on reaching ONLY those types of people. 

Dw I was in the same boat, and am slowly building up a client base. You just need to get your foot in the door with 1-2 clients and knock it out of the park. A strong portfolio and word of mouth will get you places.

Good luck! I personally would recommend TikTok before it‚Äôs gone lol. Great way to begin building an audience and get them over to a different platform of yours to build rapport. TikTok is very engaging and the datapoints are very useful. 

As in my e-book ‚ÄúWealth With Ni‚Äù ü•∏üëáüèΩsirenbysober.myshopify.com Great advice above me here. May I suggest start locally from the Chamber of Commerce website. These are people already looking to improve their business actively. Also go to networking groups such as BNI. Think local for now and even offer to meet face to face. What if i want it about my services not me?
Is it possible??? You didn't even try to answer my question? Faculty and campus organizations have lot of connections, if you are genuinely good then you will get lot of clients through them.¬† Good answer ! That is completely doable. Would you like to discuss terms and requirements from you in pms? I guess I'm just innocent, because I do not see that. XD I have been told before that sometimes my speech is ""too professional"" whatever that means. I think you should set up a website offering your services and do some paid ads Sure.

basically this idea could benefit me and solve one of my problems and could solve other people's problems.

but i still need to know if there were a way or a protocol i could follow to evaluate the problem and the solution i came up with (i know i know, do research find if people like it then launch an MVP to test how hungry the market is)","Make the product and sell it. The market will tell you better than any research or test. Take the scrub daddy sponge for example. A sponge is not a new product but add a smiley face in one and it makes millions. That's the ultimate product I can't believe is so successful. The best way is to talk with potential users who could benefit. Really focus on their problems during the conversation, before pitching your idea. It will avoid bias and you can start to identify common patterns. From there, you can continue to iterate on your solution as you get more data. Identify your target addressable market, decision factors for purchasers, and weigh that against your product advantages.   If you win this balance, I would consider it viable.

Share more details, people will give more feedback. What is stopping you from building it and getting it to the market?

You learn more with a live product than with the comments of random people on the internet.

The users will give you real feedback.

So.. back to the question:

What is stopping you from creating your idea?

You got this! You can just create stuff out of thin air.

Go for it! to be honest Scrub Daddy had a great marketing plan (which was based on research) they had a supper great team in marketing that if they wanted they could sell the ice to Eskimos.

  
i mean have you seen the pitch he made in the shark tank?

super beautiful and that because he did his research and tested as you said

and I'm willing to do the same, the test is easy, since I'm a copywriter it won't take me much to make the landing page and stuff, but the rest have to be based on research i mean you can't even write a word on the landing page with 0 research into it. that's the plan, personly i could benefit from it and even pay for it, and it's a super super super huge pain in the copywriting industry and the freelance in general, but even with a big pain there are other things fort the service to be successful or not. that's what I'm looking to figure out well there are a couple of reasons one being i don't have time i said I'm a copywriter and i have clients waiting for my deliverables and paid for them, but this isn't convenient to be honest i don't believe in this and never been one of the reasons that i quit on stuff.

  
but I don't want to waste time testing stuff online that I could invest in something else that could benefit me or my clients more.

and there is a saying in marketing and copywriting, don't through pasta on the wall and see what sticks.

I really really get sad seeing all those people just going out of the blue navigating in the dark with no research or a plan dealt in and testing all this stuff, 

only to find out that if they had taken the time and studied the project before diving headfirst into it, they would've saved more time and effort and actually made a profit.

  
and I'm making an eBook (it's more of an instruction manual) that talks about how to find the Make the Winner service.

  
and I'm in the info-gathering mode for it

  
1) to make the service I'm about to launch better

2) to write the eBook to help people learn from the trial and error I'll have so they don't have to find the info themselves or dive headfirst into it.

  
but thnx for the motivation man i appreciate it :) Focus on solving a problem.

Don't think about the other stuff. Just focus on the problem you want to solve. You will add new things later. You can improve as you go. Hard to say without knowing more details, but generally speaking the product you think will work usually will change dramatically as you talk to/ obtain more users. Key is to identify the problem (which you have), prototype, put it in front of users, get feedback, make changes, then repeat.

Getting folks to pay is another hurdle. You see it as a waste of time.

I see it as an opportunity to learn something.

Maybe if you launch the business without preparation, you learn valuable lessons that will help you launch the second business, which is the winner.

I‚Äôve been diving into entrepreneurship while balancing college and a part-time job, and I‚Äôm looking for advice on managing multiple ideas effectively. Once you start solving problems, you tend to get a flood of ideas. Even after filtering them realistically, I still find myself left with a few solid ones to work on.

Here‚Äôs my struggle: Should I focus on just one main idea, validate it, launch it, and then move on to the next? Or should I dedicate time daily to 2-3 ideas and make progress on all of them simultaneously?

For context:

* I‚Äôm in college, so my weekdays are packed until the evening.
* After college and my part-time job, I get about 2-3 hours a day to work on my ideas.
* Currently, I plan two sprints daily after my commitments. Some days are super productive, but other days I procrastinate and push tasks to the next day.
* I have started work in 4 of my own projects, although the progress is small as I am taking all of them together, there is progress but I am not happy with the speed.


How do you manage your time and focus when you have multiple viable ideas?

* Do you start every idea you think you can execute?
* How do you prevent procrastination when managing multiple priorities?
* Is it better to focus on one idea, see it through, and then move to the next?

Would love to hear your strategies, especially if you‚Äôve been in a similar situation with limited time and resources!

Thanks in advance for your insights!","I have been failing hard since a long time. And this one time I feel that I might fail again but you know what's different this time? It's that this time I care to make the change. I care to not let my voyage fail this time and hence I'm doing all my might to not let the strings snap this one time. So trust me from the experience of my failures I have learned that if you care enough, if it really matters to you, you will always find the time and energy and the Josh to pursue your work and the inner voice will keep you ahead in the game. 

You will feel like that's not me doing all this. So do what excites you what feels like only you can do this the way it has to be done. Once read something along these lines from a successful entrepreneur: ""businesses fail not for lacking good ideas, but for lacking execution"" (don't remember who said it)

It's already hard enough to make one idea work. now if you are juggling multiple business ideas, chances only decrease. Elon Musk did it but he's an alien.

Don't get stuck in analysis paralysis. That's where most people are, and why they never see any results. 

Just go. Pick one idea. the simpler the better. It‚Äôs awesome you have a lot of ideas you want to do and keep that up! 

So my personal advice for you. 
Commit to one idea you enjoy and ‚Äùtruly‚Äù believe in. 
Set up a timeline for that idea where you want to be at a certain point. (Set a short goal like 2 months) Start building and doing this. 

In the meantime you will have 1000 new ideas about things you want to do. 
Make quick notes on those ideas everytime you come up with one. Pick one day every week where you are allowed to explore 1 idea in more depth. Do research and try explore the idea but not start building. 

When the 2 months (example) have past, look at the result you made on your first idea. It‚Äôs not about finishing it or have a MVP etc but just look at the result and think is this something I‚Äôm still believe in and want to do? 

If yes, set up your next goal and timeline and repeat. This way you will always be moving something forward but are allowed to have other ideas and explore them. 

Don‚Äôt be afraid to stop doing the idea you committed to but try to finish the timeline and review your result. This way you also ‚Äùgrow‚Äù and learn and will feel like you get results from what you doing. 

Good luck on your journey and don‚Äôt be afraid to try and fail! üôè **Focus on One Main Idea**: Prioritize one idea that excites you the most or has the most potential. Validate it quickly, then launch. This helps you build momentum and avoid spreading yourself too thin. Hey there OP. So I‚Äôve been in this 15 years, many at bats. Some massive failures and a few huge wins. I now run a few small profitable businesses. The advice I‚Äôd give my younger self (because I was saying the same thing back then) is focus on one at a time, learn and grow. You will make way more progress and learn much faster focusing on one at a time. You can also learn that the one isn‚Äôt actually one you want to work on for years much quicker. Once you have some experience and success then you can more easily focus on more than one at a time. But for now just focus on one.

One podcast episode id recommend is Founders episode called How to do Great work. HIGHLY recommend it. Good luck! One at a time.  

I was in your position maybe 30 years ago.   I took out a piece of paper and wrote down all the ideas I had so I could figure out which one to work on.  Then I picked one and did it. 

I still have the piece of paper I wrote on 30 years ago. It's in the side pocket of my now very beat up briefcase, where it has been for 30 years.  A few of the ideas are now crossed out, as I've done them.  The rest of the ideas are still damn good. Built 25+ ideas in the past. Failed almost every single time.

Things started to change when I decided to focus on one single product.

Focus matters. It‚Äôs hard to keep your legs on 2 boats at the same time. When juggling multiple ideas, it can definitely feel overwhelming, especially with a full schedule. I totally get the struggle of wanting to explore everything but knowing you need to focus. One method I've found helpful is using time-blocking techniques where I allocate specific chunks of time to each project. This way, I make progress on multiple fronts without losing track of anything.   
  
I have ADHD, so staying organized and creating self boundaries is super important. That being said, strategies like group coaching or a group mastermind can provide great support to help you further your goals. It‚Äôs all about finding ways to create clarity and hold yourself accountable. Just remember, it‚Äôs okay to pivot and refocus as you learn more about what works best for you. Pick one idea, validate it quickly (talk to potential users, throw up a basic landing page, etc.), and focus on finishing it. Spreading yourself too thin makes it harder to build anything meaningful.   
With limited time, try blocking out focused sessions for just one thing instead of juggling everything. Procrastination usually comes from feeling overwhelmed, so break tasks into tiny, manageable steps.  
Ideas are cheap; execution is what matters. Get one thing done, then move to the next.

Good luck.",2025-01-11 03:43:24
Entrepreneur,", which originates from a problem I‚Äôm currently facing.","Roast my idea: Homemade dog food subscription service

Hello fellow entrepreneurs and wannapreneurs like myself :)

I want to share an idea I‚Äôm thinking about, which originates from a problem I‚Äôm currently facing.  
I have an older dog with stomach and dental issues, and the only solution is buying the most expensive dog food available on the market or preparing it myself. Cooking dog food, however, isn‚Äôt simp",,"expensive, problem, issue",,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1hyrjq0/roast_my_idea_homemade_dog_food_subscription/,Roast my idea: Homemade dog food subscription service,"Hello fellow entrepreneurs and wannapreneurs like myself :)

I want to share an idea I‚Äôm thinking about, which originates from a problem I‚Äôm currently facing.  
I have an older dog with stomach and dental issues, and the only solution is buying the most expensive dog food available on the market or preparing it myself. Cooking dog food, however, isn‚Äôt simple - it's time-consuming and requires making sure the food is nutritionally balanced, which means I need both skill and knowledge to get it right.

While I‚Äôm learning how to cook the right food for my dog, I‚Äôm also considering the possibility of turning this into a business or at least a side hustle. I would offer a subscription-based service in my hometown(I'm based in Europe) that provides high-quality, tailored dog food delivered directly to customers‚Äô doors. The food would cater to specific needs based on the dog‚Äôs age, size, and health requirements.

My target audience would be wealthy pet owners who want to provide the best nutrition for their pets or those dealing with similar issues to mine.

So, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on what do you think could be the potential challenges or roadblocks with this idea?","Look up the farmer‚Äôs dog. It‚Äôs US but in general challenges are shipping amounts that weigh a lot for more than 2 dogs and of course dry ice or freeze requirements to keep food free of bacteria. 

If you do it local delivery it‚Äôs much less complicated. But it‚Äôs still a good business opportunity if they don‚Äôt have anything in the Europe it might be an opportunity to work with them to expand.  

Best of luck and appreciate you thinking of it for pups in your area.  

Our dogs love it, but that shipment is a pain to carry and we have a dedicated freezer space to store. We have more than 2 dogs but less than 6. We spend almost the same amount on groceries as we do dog food. 

Maybe look into local pet store placement if they have freezers to start. Or provide  free chest freezer as long as they carry and sell your product? Viva Raw in the US does this, kind of. They have some stories on socials about how they did it. VERY picky and quick to anger clientele‚Äîpeople who view their pets as children will nail you to the wall at the smallest slip-up, and when making quality-first food, the standards are near impossible. 

However they are still profitable as far as I can tell. I wanted to hate it but I think your model might work. You should look at requirements for dog food selling (e.g any hygiene standards?) and i would engage a lab that test samples on a regular basis to go above and beyond. That will help you if anything ever goes wrong and it will build trust with your customers. With the distrust in a lot of companies and all the scandals, you might have a niche. See if you can make it for more than just rich people, calculate how much stuff would cost. (include your time, energy cost, insurance etc) Provided you live in an affluent area I think it could work, how about linking up with  a posh boarding kennels to advertise [removed] Liability Butternut box I am about to start using this exact service. 

I would say the only gap in your idea is how long the food lasts vs postage. 
Mine is raw meals frozen and you thaw it yourself. This is a really popular and proven model here in Australia. There are a bunch, but the one that pushes ads hard is ""Lyka"" (https://lyka.com.au/). They have a few different targets with their food around allergies, stomach issues, etc, but the core premise is home-made dog food.

I was looking at using them, as I have an 11 1/2 year old german shepherd who gets itchy, and wanted to put him on a single protein elimination diet to try and rule things out, but they were crazy expensive per meal. I'm quite sure there are lots of people that happily pay it, though. Validate the idea. Get a couple of paying customers first. Don‚Äôt try to think too much about the idea and instead talk to your potential customers. Check out butternut box they send dog food subscriptions frozen into blocks, you defrost overnight in the fridge. Sounds good, stay local‚Äîgreat idea üòä

Maybe try to sign up 3-5 pet owners. And do that for a week or two. 

I would suggest real marketing and hustle to try to get your first clients‚Äînot run through your family and friends first for false positives. 

And if scale is your issue consider freezing your food (iknow), but you might have a new product they can leave in the freezer. 

I can see you want to make custom food but you want to make food for your dog specifically, why not sell the recipe ‚Äúas is‚Äù for senior dogs with stomach and dental issues, better yet see if this is problem is dog breed specific and you can market in your dog breed specific groups.

All the best! there is a movement against these businesses. In the pet industry myself and a certified canine nutritionist. Look up Farmers Dog and pancreatitis. Vets are 100% against these due to incorrect ratios. If you formulated it properly and marketed that way, possibility but you need a vet to back it and that isnt as easy as it once was due to such a large increase of dogs suffering from pancreatitis caused by delivery dog foods I think it‚Äôs a good idea. You could start small and keep it local at first. Try posting in FB groups, for example, to see if people would actually buy it.

I live in Mexico, and my sister has a dog that she treats like her child. She only buys locally made dog food from a guy in our neighborhood (and yes, it‚Äôs overpriced), but the dog loves it, and that makes her happy too. So you might be onto something here.

My recommendation would be to start locally before investing in a website or app. Years ago, a prospective tenant was looking at a property to relocate their rabbit farm.

The rabbits were grown to be processed into dog food delivered out of a Ford Transit in the local area.

The wife was some kind of credentialed nutritionist and the husband was more on the operations side from what I recall.

(This wasn't in the U.S./EU so don't ask me about regulations.) One of the biggest issues direct-to-consumer brands face is the massive costs of performance marketing to acquire a single customer (CAC), mixed with low margins due to the expense of producing a product that requires compliance with Animal Feed Hygiene rules and obtaining HACCP to showcase you‚Äôre a safe manufacturer, plus the ingredients and labelling requirements. This means your capital expenditure will be significantly high before you even have a product ready and if you have a hyper-localised go to market strategy this may put off any investors due to the lack of scalability. 

You can check some of the requirements and hurdles you may face in Europe by searching for European Pet Food Industry Federation and reviewing their resources. I like the idea. There‚Äôs a person at the local farmers market that sells dog food and treats. 

I would be worried about picky customers. But I think there‚Äôs potential Go for it. There‚Äôs hundreds of these brands in the US already Pretty unlikely to succeed. Affluent people are very picky and they definitely won't just choose a random person to start feeding their pet. 

This would require a great deal of brand building and reputation building to succeed. Unless you already have access to a social circle of affluent homeowners with pets, this will be difficult. 

I market for affluent brands and one of their biggest problems is finding their very specific target niche at scale. Awesome idea, you are doing it anyway so you can prove concept at the same time as doing it for your own pet. Also love the idea of subscription especially if you offer something different and tailored compared to the market as it will lock them in long term Multiple ones in the UK. Pet food is a lucrative business and if planned right may be solid. I would definitely look into distributing through pet shops rather than offer D2C through subscription to keep costs at check and liabilities at minimum It already exists In Italy there‚Äôs already https://dogfydiet.com If you can handle local delivery or pickups then definitely do it. The issue with most delivery services is food staying frozen in transit, especially in the summet Staying localüëç Getting the clientele would be too hard Do you mean like the Farmers Dog does? Or Ollie? Freshpet? Nom nom..? Pets Table? All big brands w investor $ that have been doing fresh pet food delivery for a while & several probably have a very efficient supply chain established.

No, I wouldn‚Äôt start a dog food delivery co this late in the game, unless I was able to differentiate & serve a niche customer that wasn‚Äôt being served at all & had plenty of investor $ to chase that customer. I‚Äôm also pretty sure these previously mentioned brands offer specialized plans for senior dog vs puppy, etc.

I think anybody starting out rn is going to have a tough time chipping away at the marketshare that some of these megacorp backed companies have on lock.¬†

You asked my opinion. Hope it helps. I love it. A friend of mine was just telling me yesterday that she doesn't buy dog food for her puppy. I was startled because I'm pretty sure even the cheapest kibble is more nutritionally balanced than just boiling a chicken every few days and mixing it with rice. 

So I'd 100% buy into something like this if you seemed knowledgeable about creating balanced, cooked meals. Bonus points for adding probiotics etc Not a dog owner.but a former. That sounds like a flop bud.i would abandon the idea. if you want to be roasted, this is definitely the right place lol Ollie already exists. Can anyone here help me with Thoughts on luxury Pet Calenders 
I have been thinking of starting a side hustle selling luxury pet calendars, starting with dogs, the calendars I see online are mainly treat based so I‚Äôm thinking of including toys, shampoo, pup cups, collar accessories, but I have safety concerns re the toys and with the cost of postage and packing, for 25 items the sale price could end up being ¬£130 (UK ), is that too much for target market which would be professional couples ?
Any help greatly appreciated, even if it crushes my dream !! I would never trust a small side hustle with my dog food. If you had a business establishment that was certified and inspected, sure, but my rotty nearly died after catching parasites off of poorly prepared meat and it was the worst experience in my life, look at the horrors of Rainbow Coffee or any time a TikTok influencer tries to ignore regulations and make their own products for consumption, I would never trust a home business in a million years Liability is a legal consideration in all businesses. I don't see why it would be a bigger issue for this idea than anyone others. People just feed their dogs their own home cooked meals already.  

-end roast.

I still like it, send out some tests in your neighbourhood, hand out samples at the dog park, see if clients ""bite"" :) He‚Äôs in Europe mate.  
Look up from time to time. It‚Äôs a big old world out there. Don‚Äôt hijack someone else‚Äôs thread [removed] People who feed their dogs their own home cooked meals don't sue themselves when the dog has an allegric reaction or dies. Gross. Lot of judgment & assumptions in this one. A question was asked & I answered, from my viewpoint & discussing the other companies I‚Äôm aware of. OP can take what he needs & leave the rest, all of which has nothing to do with your unnecessary input.¬† Not my intention but unable to submit a post of my own i don‚Äôt have enough Karma I take it ,I have contacted support, apologies everyone A house does not have certified hygiene standards, nor temperature failsafes to guarantee safe handling of frozen or prepared meat, good luck finding someone who‚Äôs willing to insure you on these conditions, otherwise kill someone‚Äôs dog and get destroyed with legal bills sure I think depending on where you are food prep licensing requirements should help to ensure consumers (even pets) are kept safe. There's some tough regulations in Australia to avoid that sort of thing. [removed] Thanks I don‚Äôt mean to be so stern it really was traumatising watching him inches from death due to something so preventable",2025-01-11 03:25:56

If you are successful please help me and guide me I‚Äôm willing to pay for your time and knowledge ,"Bro you are basically covering yourself in fish guts and jumping into the shark tank posting this please have common sense with anyone that comes offering guidance Everything can work, but you need to do it long enough. I tried out 4 different things and gave up every time before I saw results. Now 3 months ago I started my first legit business and finally see results slowly. 

First month made my first dollars, second month my first $1k, and this month I'm on track to make $3k. Right now I see a clear path to make this a $50k per month business. 

It just takes time and hard work - even if you don't see results, you need to continue.

Just pick one thing and do it for long enough. What are you trying to do and what‚Äôs your skillset and credentials? No mentor/coach can help you if they don‚Äôt even know what you do, and anyone who say they can is just scamming you >¬†I have money to invest.¬†

Its called VOO. Open up a brokerage account and put it all in VOO and sit back. alright, here‚Äôs an idea you won‚Äôt get from the usual hustle bros or the ‚Äúdrop everything and learn coding‚Äù crowd:

stop trying to be the person doing the work. instead, be the middleman‚Äîa professional connect-the-dots-er

example:
you don‚Äôt need to know web design, marketing, or whatever the hot skill is right now. find people who do know it (go on Fiverr, Upwork, or any freelancer platform). then go find clients who need those services but hate freelancers (small businesses love paying more for someone who just handles things). charge the client 2x what you pay the freelancer. congrats, you‚Äôre now running a business. and the best part? you never have to do any of the actual work, just emails and invoices

people don‚Äôt think about this because they‚Äôre obsessed with being ‚Äúthe expert‚Äù or learning new skills. but being the middleman is timeless. everyone wants someone else to deal with the annoying stuff

so then your investment goes into building trust, not doing labor. spend money on a decent-looking website, a solid LinkedIn profile, and maybe some ads to target local businesses. keep the operation lean, don‚Äôt overpromise, and focus on good communication. once you get one client, you just copy-paste the process

it‚Äôs not glamorous, and it‚Äôs not revolutionary, but it works because you‚Äôre solving a problem people will pay to make go away: ‚Äúugh, i don‚Äôt want to deal with this‚Äù Here are 2 things I can share, which helped me generate ideas:

1) Events for entrepreneurs 
Look if there are any happening in your area and visit the. They usually have a networking part or speakers who are sharing about their success. Listening to those stories can help you get inspiration. During the networking part, talk to people and listen to their problems. Are they experiencing something you might be able to solve?

2) Reddit 
Follow subreddit you are interested in, something you would potentially like to work on later. Just read through threads and comments, people are very often talking about the problems they are having. Aka yourself 3 questions: are more people talking about the same problem? Is there already a solution out there? Is it something I could solve 

If you want to generate ideas, hope you will find this helpful It sounds like you‚Äôre super motivated to make a change, and that‚Äôs a great place to start. I‚Äôve been where you are, trying everything and not knowing what really works. 

For me, the turning point was focusing on one thing and getting really good at it. I started with digital products and digital marketing. It‚Äôs a business model with low upfront costs, and once you create a product (like templates, guides, or printables), you can sell it over and over.

If you‚Äôre looking to invest, you could also look into buying ‚Äúdone-for-you‚Äù digital products with resell rights and focus on marketing them instead of creating from scratch.

Another idea is to think about what skills you already have and how you can monetize them, freelancing or coaching in something you‚Äôre good at can be a great way to bring in extra income while building something bigger on the side.

The key is to focus, stay consistent, and give it time to grow. I‚Äôd be happy to share more about what worked for me or help you brainstorm ideas if you‚Äôre interested x > I‚Äôm willing to pay for your time and knowledge 

There's a reason most advice is free, it's not worth paying for. I am fresh out of prison after 15 years of being incarcerator. I am currently having a hard time finding work that is sufficient to support. Family sings how I am a felon. I have a criminal record my background over the past months. I have been learning all I can on the web and little tutorial classes, learning how to be a content creator or video editor. I know it‚Äôs a longshot to landa job at doing something that I have notgotten degree in. my question is is anyone know of anyone willing to give an expelling opportunity to get a job or get a degree in learning more about being a content, creator or video editor/web designer is something I truly enjoy doing and I feel like I‚Äôm really picking it up really fast. I know a lot of people have different taste in music, but I‚Äôm just gonna throw you a few videos on here so you can see some of the stuff I‚Äôm talking about. I am sitting on more ideas than I can do in the lifetime.


They are niche. They can be profitable. They have serious USPs and there is market demand. You will make my life better if you do one of them and I know a community that feels the same.¬†


None of the ideas are software. All of them require real work to make work and would become a real business that could be a household name.

No, but seriously, ""I tried everything"" is usually the mark of someone who doesn't stick to anything for long enough.  
In many cases, you'll be needing skillsets more than good ideas.  
And if nothing works, I can always recommend a good brainstorming session on ChatGPT I guess... one redditor said it, I'll say it again: find your ikigai. you can do ""forest bathing"", doing exercise and meditating by being alone in the nature to listen to your inner voice. you can brainstorm ideas with chat gpt, too. need good prompts? there are good chat gpt communities here on reddit.

Copy other businesses but be unique. Read 'The millionaire fastlane' by MJ demarco it will help Check out your DM [removed] I also am really stuck, I'm 16, I get fed so much info and I honestly have no idea in which direction to go. I am open to any business idea/opportunity, networking event, mentor, honestly anything would help. Lol if you're smart you will realise no one who's successful will be giving you the answers. 

Why haven't you figured it out yet? You're more than welcome to DM and ask your questions. Will help where I can bro if you have money to invest, just invest in ido ipo and seed rounds and get return ""I'm smart."" I agree and watch out for the instant ""DMed you"" Do your own research etc. If it sounds too good or too easy.... His DM goes burrr. Hopefully he validates and does some background check before he starts paying someone. Free labor and the guy to blame if it doesn't go right. What more could someone want lol I feel like this is my problem I start something I don‚Äôt see result and I ‚Äúgive up‚Äù I‚Äôll pick something and I‚Äôll go hard for 6 months to a year. It‚Äôs bound to happen This but knowing the metrics to pivot if need be into something else. Iterate fast and learn from failures. Only good investing advice he's getting here... And this is why inflation is so high How do I find my customers ? I‚Äôm currently 6 months into digital marketing‚Ä¶ I have two products which are ebook/guides.

There are only so many hours in a day.¬† That appears pretty sound. How did you validate demand? That‚Äôs the part I am struggling with. I‚Äôd love to get in on this if you wouldn‚Äôt mind. Not even sharing the ideas but trying to understand where I can seek ideas and get inspiration. I‚Äôve been racking my brain for weeks. And for years I‚Äôve never taken the plunge because my ideas are always vitamins and not painkillers. I need a must have How? I just have questions? My bad, but I get it. I‚Äôll do my research but it would be nice having guidance you know? Not show more like hey I have a question about this or that Yes! I‚Äôm really passionate in making money on the internet. I‚Äôm a funded trader I was able to make 20k in 3 months but this month I‚Äôm down and made me realized I need to expand. I said 3k because that‚Äôs money I make consistently. I‚Äôve tried clothing & drop shipping. I just asked to get some ideas that I haven‚Äôt discovered yet Thank you for this! DO NOT accept DMs kid. Keep it all public so we can help protect you. My best advice. Start by turning inword. Learn yourself and why you want success. Why you want to be an enterperneur. When you for sure can get by building from a place of material and statistical gain. As soon as the rubber really meets the road and things get hectic you won't have a stronghold to fall back on. A few things that helped me in the beginning:
1. Realize that enterperneurship is not for everyone and that's okay. 
2. Realize that the glamourous influencerperneurs driving around rentals and leasing their homes are 9/10 a facade. Enterperneurial work is not glamerous like it's often portrayed online. It's hard even soul crushing at times.
3.familiarize yourself with the japaneese concept of ikigai to give you direction and understand your strengths.
4.Books are your mentors long before people ever will be.
5.if someone says 'X business model is dead' they're 100% wrong and trying to sell you a course.
6. Don't ever buy courses unless you're highly specialized and even then you should generally opt for coaching.
7. Go to local business owner meetups and network. 
If you'd like my favorite book reccomendations reply to this and I'll post them here. This reply is already long so I don't want to make it worse than it has to be. I hope this helps. Dude, just pick something where your upfront cost is less than $200 or so and run hard with it.

Reassess in a month.

Rinse, wash and repeat and eventually you'll find something that works. Smart in a sense that I‚Äôm a fast learner, I have common sense, I can be taught and I will apply and listen. Also I am very tech savvy Stop lol Lol, post kind of suggests otherwise right? A proclaimed entrepreneur selling the secret to bitches super cars and generational railroad ownership? Blasphemy Your ideas are so valuable that you consider giving advice to be 'free labor'? That's the way to go, and in this process when it gets hard, you will think ""Oh my, why didn't I pick something else?"" But the truth is simply there is no easy path - it is just hard. No matter which route you take, it is hard, and you have to accept it. Btw Check out this podcast episode it resonated with me: [https://youtu.be/qkcFcwb6mk0?si=ciOPoiiXfhDICcQA](https://youtu.be/qkcFcwb6mk0?si=ciOPoiiXfhDICcQA) There‚Äôs your problem right there bud.  You can‚Äôt stick out the hard parts long enough to see results.

Get a therapist and work that shit out before you waste yours and other people‚Äôs money. I wonder why not QQQ? That‚Äôs amazing, you‚Äôve already got two products and are six months in! It sounds like you‚Äôre putting in the work, which is such a big step. But I also know how disheartening it can be when you‚Äôre showing up everyday, doing the work & still not making sales. 

A couple of thoughts‚Ä¶ 

Think about how you can connect with your current audience (which, if you‚Äôre in digital marketing, is probably a lot of other digital marketers) while also creating content that speaks to your ideal client. For your current audience, share tips, tools, or relatable experiences. For your ideal client, focus on showing how your e-books solve a specific problem and make their lives easier. It‚Äôs that ‚Äòserving over selling‚Äô mindset that really makes a difference, so rather than thinking ‚Äòhow can I make sales today‚Äô ask yourself ‚Äòwho can I serve/ how can I serve today‚Äô. 

Most of my sales have come from my stories on IG, TT lives, and my email marketing. Use your stories to get to know your followers, ask questions, use polls and stickers etc. 

The more you connect with your audience, the more targeted and valuable your content becomes.

If you‚Äôd like, feel free to message me your social media handle, I‚Äôd be happy to take a look and share some feedback or ideas xx It's what I desperately need myself. That's why I know there is strong demand.


Heck honestly, come compete with future me I'll be more transparent and share my story that let's me know there is demand in this market.


So I'm really sensitive to environmental toxicity like a lot of types of chemicals and mold. There are maybe hundreds of thousands of people actively looking for these products and they are hard to build correctly (though the secret is simplicity and making them *real* like the way things were 500 years ago). I'm in Facebook groups with a lot of them and it's a top of mind daily conversation. I see the possible solutions because I'm a Biochemist and artisanal crafts are my preferred hobbies.


The easiest things I think the world needs are *real* products. No plastic coating high tech, etc, but real glass without colors, real pottery with safe glaze (clear or specific white and specific clay), real metal uncoated cooking tools and silverware, real beds made from cotton and wool (never chemically straightened... That's why people don't like wool now, that and the unsafe dyes), real clothes made with natural materials and protected from mold and second hand pesticides all the way from farm to my hands.¬†


If someone made the clothes and made them right I would love them forever. Really. Forever. I mean I'm married but that's the biggest bane of my daily existence right now.


The demand is validated because I actually have been paid to coach people to try to find products and housing like this for themselves. It is so rare, and for me making these kind of swaps changed my life. I was really really sick and disabled and now I live a pretty normal happy life. I can walk again. I'm not in pain at all most days. My mental health is good. I'm able to enjoy life and work more than full-time. Others are aware that this can be the impact for them and they can and do spend a *lot* on finding lower toxicity places and things.¬†


I will advise anyone who is serious about making low toxicity products. I'm certified in Environmental Public Health and I'm really passionate about it. Yeah. There are a few types of entrepreneurship it seems. Some are clever ways to make money, and they can surely be a good lifestyle business. Others are a life experience you can't unlive that gives you a deep understanding of a unique set of needs and problems to solve. There are definitely more flavors than that (like franchise, true passion business like monetizing art, etc) but those two flavors are the ones I think about with businesses usually these days.¬†


I don't know how to tag people on here but I am on vacation so I have some time to connect and kick ideas around if you want. Playing business ideas when they are fresh and new is a lot of fun I think :-). I'm good at seeing what has sufficient profit potential pretty quickly (I can math a business in my head really fast usually). Let's connect if you want :-). After this week I'll be really busy again though. Listen to AdventousWozzle. They make sense. Software business sexy but precarious if you're not tech savvy. Making money on the internet is a steep. How does he know you're not the one he needs protected from? Just saying.. I would be interested in your book recommendations! statue ? Both are basically the same, some people just like Vanguard I appreciate this!!! Thank you [deleted] That would be amazing! how about this, I‚Äôll spend this week brainstorming as much as I can and reach out to you end of the week and we can have a quick convo?

No it doesn't seem smart to make chemicals in your bathrub. *Using* any chemicals in your bathtub even isn't too smart (and yes I even mean shampoo). But that is another topic for another day. It's early this week I have some time so like maybe Tuesday? You can PM me and we can set up a time to talk. thank you, i already got some Dm‚Äôs Stay off DMs in all social media unless you have met the person face to face",2025-01-11 01:29:23

A quick and dirty book could be "" Million dollar weekend"" by Noah Kagan. Two thoughts on this:

1. The best problems to solve are the ones you experience yourself.  I'm sure there's situations where you've not been able to find a suitable solution to a problem or need that you have.  A first hand problem will also be more personal will also help you with the passion around the solution.

Bonus:  Coming up with ideas should be the least of your concerns.  You should focus on how am I going to execute the plan.  Focus on the kinetic energy behind the idea.  Dreamers come up with ideas and successful people build and sell things. 1. Find what you like doing and what general area that is. Example, you could really like doing stuff outdoors (hunting, fishing, etc). The goal is to find a people group that you can relate with.

2. Look for problems there. If you focus on just finding general problems you won‚Äôt have a drive to solve them if you hate doing it.

3. Ask people about those problems. But NOT as a business owner. Don‚Äôt lead questions, don‚Äôt ask for yes and no responses. 
Example: I build e-commerce websites for small businesses. When I asked questions they were‚Ä¶
‚ÄúWhat are the 5 biggest headaches in your business‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat things take up the most time in your day‚Äù
‚ÄúIf you could snap your fingers and 5 tasks were gone what would they be?‚Äù

4. Listen for pain-points and write them down. If your service/product isn‚Äôt repeated as a common pain point then shift.

5. Once you find a pain point figure out a solution and get dang good at what you do. To get your first customers/leads have those people be a part of building the solution so they feel connected to you. It also helps so they are building something they want and likely their peers will to.

6. Over performing will help you get tons of leads. If you do a great job people will refer others to you. How do i find such ppl? Why would they want to talk to me? Is there a way to connect with such ppl? yes! talking is the best way. books are great, but nothing beats talking imo. Also, the term gap immediately reminded me of SEO gaps. If you know how to use a keyword research tool, learn how to gather the necessary data, and throw it on claude, you can find some actionable gaps to act on. Such people? Like‚Ä¶ everyone has something they‚Äôre willing to give someone money to do for them. Do you have anyone in your phone contacts? Socials? Family? Friends?",2025-01-10 22:19:34

Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm looking for advice on starting a side business and would appreciate any insights you can share! Here‚Äôs my situation:
	
Background: 

I currently work in IT and want to build a small business alongside my job. I have the technical skills to set up and manage an e-commerce website independently.

Finances: 

I can save around ‚Ç¨2,500 from my current job each month and have ‚Ç¨5,000 in savings to invest upfront. My monthly fixed cost would be roughly ‚Ç¨100 for an accountant, not including hosting, wordpress theme, etc. (planing to host on wordpress platform, as have some experience maintaining it)

Market: 

I‚Äôm targeting a market of just under 1 million people. There‚Äôs only one major LEGO retailer in the area, and their prices are quite high. This makes me think there‚Äôs room for a more affordable, customer-focused option.

Focus: 

For now, I‚Äôd like to specialize in LEGO products because they are well-known and have consistent demand. However, my long-term goal is to expand into other categories of toys and games as the business grows.

Strengths:
	‚Ä¢	IT expertise: I can build, manage, and optimize a webshop on my own. I can automate things, write scripts, import products automatically and so on. 
	‚Ä¢	Dedication: I‚Äôm ready to put in consistent effort to make this work.

Weaknesses:
	‚Ä¢	No marketing knowledge: I don‚Äôt know much about running ads, social media strategies, or creating brand awareness.
	‚Ä¢	Lack of experience: I‚Äôve never run an online business before, nor have I conducted market research.

My Questions:
	1.	What‚Äôs the best way to validate the demand for LEGO (or toys in general) in my market before fully committing?
	2.	How much inventory would you recommend I start with, given my budget?
	3.	What‚Äôs the most effective way for a beginner to learn marketing and drive traffic to a new webshop?
	4.	Are there any common pitfalls I should watch out for when starting an e-commerce business?
	5.	Do you think starting with LEGO and later expanding to other toy categories is a good strategy?

I‚Äôd love to hear from anyone. Your advice and tips would mean a lot!

Thanks in advance!","Hi there mate! Currently am trying out a similar thing which has gained popularity ever since i started it.

I wrote to Lego and waiting for their answer. There is no exclusive retailer here, and also some few small shops sell them, so I guess there wont be any legal impediments regarding this. Thanks! 
I am looking to position on the local market inside the country, cause my country almost does not use amazon, because the majority of sellers do not ship to us.",2025-01-10 16:24:13

Or anything else?","No.  And there‚Äôs no preferential tax treatment either. We often have to have x% of our contacts go to MWBE business because of American policies.   For whatever that is worth to you! Depends on what you're selling. If your target audience is moms, then you probably will find that you get business that way. 

Women relate to the stories of women who are struggling to keep it all together and took a chance on their passion to do it. 
The main point of the SBA certifications (like woman owned) is to qualify for government contract set asides and small business loans. There‚Äôs also classes and programs offered for free to certified businesses. 

Something like 3% of gov contracts are set aside for woman owned small businesses. The woman needs to own at least 51% if it‚Äôs a partnership. I work for a M/WBE (WBENC Certified). I am one of 4 men in the company, and 1 of the 2 ""administrators"" (me and the owner, she's obviously a woman, and minority). Our head count varies, but it's almost always at least 70-80% women.

The advantages we see: Holding the certification gives access/preference to some contracts, particularly those related to governmental organizations. We also tend to attract other women or minority owned businesses to work with us, particularly clients who are smaller and niche. For our niche (commercial printing) this is advantageous because many marketing and retail professionals are women also.  
  
u/Sturgillsturtle asked what the qualifiers are, and it depends on the certifying body. 

For WBENC, 51% ownership by a woman. For M/WBE (same thing, but minority owned) that also means 51% must be owned/operated by minorities. My company is certified for both. Do women owned business get preferential treatment? What happened to equality? Mostly Tax purposes. There are many designations. But _____ business enterprise (insert protected class) have many advantages.     
From tax, to licensure, city / county certificates of approval. Etc. All the red tape is cut quicker when you are XYZ. Woman, foreign, sexually something sometimes... whatever.   
    
MBE - Minority Business Enterprise.     
WBE - Women's Business Enterprise.    
VBE, they go on and on and on. It really depends.  If they are overtly ""pro women based owner"" type of people then yes.  But it really depends.  Also are you including this fact in your marketing.  Is it part of your branding?  If not then it might not matter as much.  Also do you do partnerships with organizations that focus on women owned businesses.  In that case it might be helpful. Weird. I'm posting links directly from Google.     
Relating to MBE, SBE, VBE.... protected class business enterprise; licensing and tax benefits.     
My comments are actively being deleted/ removed by the mods.      
I'm not saying anything controversial. Are those 2 perks not enough? Is YOUR personal brand the foundation of your business? I purposely avoid businesses that have labels like this.¬† Most retail is for female customers-- like take a trip to any mall as a guy and there's like 2 stores for you.¬†


Women know how other women think, and that's a huge advantage.


As a guy I would be out of my depth selling consignment clothes or candles, and I'm pretty sure literally any women would be better than me at it¬† Being a woman-owned business can definitely have its perks beyond just taxes or government contracts. For one, it can help you stand out‚Äîpeople are often drawn to supporting women entrepreneurs, especially in industries where diversity is a big focus. Plus, there are a lot of networks and organizations that specifically back women in business, which can open doors for funding, mentorship, and collaboration.

Also, some customers just like to support women-owned brands, which can lead to more loyalty. It can even create a positive image, with people seeing it as empowering to shop from or work with women-led businesses. So, while it varies, a lot of women find that it helps them connect with customers and grow their network. Depends what you‚Äôre doing. The extra support will come from women and government with small/negligible amounts being from male owned businesses. What even qualifies as a woman owned business? 

Woman own isn‚Äôt woman founded so I‚Äôd imagine that‚Äôs not a requirement. Does it have to be majority own by women? 

Does it qualify if a husband and wife are the sole owners 50% is woman owned in that situation. 

Or is there no minimum as long as a woman is a shareholder it‚Äôs women owned You get paid on time - but if there are specs to meet - u better be 100% and never ever claim they are if not In business there is no women or men difference. There are male and female Karens and then there are normal people. Women are usually nicer to look at though, not gonna lie. My buddy has a small business that does contract work for the USDOE. His wife is the official owner of the business. He technically works for her and does all the heavy lifting. 

They have won some pretty solid contracts over the last few years because of USDOE procurement policy. Honestly it makes me want to get in the game too with my wife. How does that work in a company is owned by a husband and wife? 

Give her an extra percent? Without a prenup pretty much any company owned completely by a heterosexual married couple could be ‚Äúwoman owned‚Äù 

Also how does a company who prides itself as woman owned and operated with 80% female employees not open itself up to lawsuits for blatant discrimination?

Edit not saying there shouldn‚Äôt be woman owned just if it‚Äôs certified woman own and operated and that a key part of the marketing how has an ambulance chasing lawyer not started chasing down males who didn‚Äôt get a job there. Sue, threaten discovery knowing there‚Äôs probably some level of discrimination in there because it‚Äôs part of the company identity. Collect settlement when the companies legal team realize application were 40% male but interviews were only 5% male or something along those lines  There are certifying bodies and organizations that aim to support women-owned businesses.
  
The intent is to compensate for perceived pressures against enterprising women and girls. As there's no data being referenced here, and I don't intend to dig any up, I won't speak to the reality of it.   
  
I'm sure any serious person could spend all day speaking to the nuances involved, and a lifetime researching it. Yup. Biggest disadvantaged group in the world right now are straight white males. There is literally benefits for every sex and ethnicity except white cis male ...

People give women owned businesses preferential treatment BECAUSE of the lack of equality in entrepreneurship. Women and minorities face additional hurdles, so some consumers decide to support them since the know the system is bosses against them. 

As long as the systemic issues exist, people will find ways to support the individuals within their personal capacity What tax benefits are you aware of?  Do share. A woman-owned business is a business that is at least 51% owned, controlled, and operated by one or more women A woman owned business is a woman that owns the business. >How does that work in a company is owned by a husband and wife?

>Give her an extra percent? Without a prenup pretty much any company owned completely by a heterosexual married couple could be ‚Äúwoman owned‚Äù

Maybe. Not sure. There are site visits and reviews of things like finances, personnel, eligibility.   
[Certification Process - WBENC : WBENC](https://www.wbenc.org/certification/certification-process/) And then also since I am Chicago area (different areas have their own systems for this) [City of Chicago :: Certification - M/WBE Program](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/dps/provdrs/cert/svcs/minority_and_womenownedbusinessenterprisecertificationmbewbe.html) so I am sure they would try to sus out any gaming of the system. 

>Also how does a company who prides itself as woman owned and operated with 80% female employees not open itself up to lawsuits for blatant discrimination?

I get what you're saying, and someone could try if they wanted, I guess, but I doubt much would come of it. We have men employed here are varying levels, top to bottom, and always have. We're partnered with male consultants (contracted). Would be a hard case to win probably. If that started happening, then people could sue any company that is 80% of *anything*. So that would mean if a company were in an area that is predominantly Christian, White, and American born and just happens to have hired all people that are all like that, they could be sued on the basis of religious, racial, and national origin discrimination which are all protected. It's easy to start ginning up frivolous lawsuits if you view it that way. Most of the time you need some evidence that those things are part of the decision-making process. For us, it just so happens that most project managers, graphic designers, packers, etc who apply to work with us are women, therefore, it's mostly women in those roles. We've had men in those positions in the past, but the pool of applicants is what it is. We can't force men to apply for those roles. Just like with our installers, CNC operators, and technical staff have typically been primarily male applicants, and therefore are male employees. 

If a company is advertising ""We only hire X"" that is a different story entirely. upvote for bringing the reasoning to the table in an objective way. I know how prone to arguement redditors can be so I just wanted to acknowledge your approach Today, I just saw a white male cis get convicted on a felony but get no fine or jail time Load of nonsense. The marketplace dictates value. Sounds like issues that the free market should take care of just fine. Seems to me the best way to oppress any group of people is to give other groups of people preferential treatment. Minority-owned businesses (MBEs) in California don't receive special **federal** tax breaks, but they can take advantage of other tax benefits.¬†These benefits include:¬†

Tax credits:¬†Businesses can receive tax credits for investing in community development entities (CDEs).¬†MBEs can also double as CDEs.¬†

Tax relief:¬†Businesses can receive tax relief for establishing themselves in certain areas.¬†

California Competes Tax Credit (CCTC):¬†Businesses can earn a credit for meeting yearly milestones for full-time employment, salary levels, and project investment.¬†

Tax benefits for working with MBEs:¬†Businesses can receive tax benefits for working with other MBEs.¬†

Tax benefits for working in low-income areas:¬†Businesses can receive tax benefits for working in low-income areas.¬†

California Competes Tax Credit¬†

The Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz) negotiates tax credit agreements.

The California Competes Tax Credit Committee approves the agreements.

The credit is not refundable, but it can be carried over for up to six years.

Application process¬†

Application is free. It's not some secret - sacred knowledge..... I get that people will down vote me based on identity politics and such. But c'mon. Has anybody ever looked into starting their own business. Creating an LLC, Tax ID, licensure and such.    
    
I have. You would know. How does that work with a business owned and operated by a couple? surely its a business that is owned by a woman Sounds like your company is doing everything right and most probably are just seems like it would be a prime area of litigation. 

Feel like it‚Äôs an area there could be some very blatant discrimination that isn‚Äôt viewed as discrimination by the individuals doing it because they are righting a wrong from years past. 

Key would be to look at applicant demographics when compared to interview to employees. Could use employee demographics related to surrounding community as justification initially since it could be evaluated without digging through files. Not a single time in my life have I ever purchased a product or service because men owned the enterprised or because women did not.¬† Tariffs and subsides exist.  Both alter the value from the ""dictates of the market"".  Thus your claim of ""load of nonsense"" is false . Who is 'the marketplace'?   
  
There are always and only humans making decisions, the 'marketplace' is just a convenient abstraction to mean 'people'. 

For homogenous product offering, some people (consumers or business decision makers alike) make decision solely based on price. Some don't and will choose with whatever reflect their values.  
  
'The marketplace dictates value.' is an oversimplification. Useful sometimes. Wrong often. OK fine, then people voting with their wallets that they prefer women ran businesses is the market telling you that women ran businesses add value to their products/services OK, that's for MBEs (which are defined in California as ""minority"" owned - can be all male) but not owned by a woman necessarily.  What are the benefits for businesses owned by women?

In the states I've practiced in the types of programs you're listing for CA were related to mostly blighted areas and other areas the state was trying to redevelop.  It would be interesting if CA is handing out free cash for all areas (and probably part of why they have such budget shortfalls.) I'm a CPA and am not aware of any tax benefits related to being a woman, but I'm always open to learning new things.  That's why I asked.  Care to point us all in the right direction?

I've also never heard of gender based LLC benefits, so let us know which state that's happening in. Hire more women than men.  Or adjust Her ownership to 51%. Not a woman that is owned by a business? Got it You‚Äôre a victim. I get it now. MBE and WBE are in the same category. Same as Veteran business enterprise. Same as everything else on the list. They are State programs. Not blighted areas. I worked for MBE in LA for years. I just replied with a list of info, I believe the mods have flagged or removed it. I'll try again.     
Minority-owned businesses (MBEs) and women-owned businesses (WBEs) can receive tax benefits and incentives from the federal, state, and local governments. These benefits can also apply to investors who buy into these businesses. Tax benefits for MBEs and WBEs
Tax incentives
The federal government offers tax incentives to businesses that work with MBEs and WBEs. 
Reduced tax liabilities
Projects funded by federal or state grants or loans have reduced tax liabilities if the supplier is an MBE or WBE. 
Tax credits
Investors who buy into MBEs and WBEs may qualify for tax credits. 
Capital gains tax waivers
Investors who buy into MBEs and WBEs may qualify for capital gains tax waivers. The keyword is ‚Äúoperated‚Äù. 
A married couple can‚Äôt post the wife as President or majority owner - and do nothing while the husband actually runs the business. Does that happen in real life? Yes. Lmao, you're projecting. I'm not a woman. You hate the fact that people are free to spend their money how they choose. Grow up. I'm a man. We literally dominate entrepreneurship. We dominate fashion, an industry where the primary consumers are women. If you are unable to compete against a woman because 1% of the population support her just on the fact that she is a women alone, you're just a trash businessman. There are rooms women don't have access to. Conversations with men they will never have. An ability to command respect that they don't have. If you have all of this and still fail to compete against a woman, she IS the better entrepreneur. Skill issue. Don't know what else to tell you. They're not.  Again, post some citations.  It sounds like you're making things up.  

Again, post citations for tax breaks for WBEs.  Not a one-off project that's for both MBEs and WBEs or a one-off tax break related to a specific project.

You are implying that there is some vast trove of $$$$ out there for women.  I'm sure the women reading would love to know about it. So no actual citations of federal tax code? Hm.  Sounds like project pork and would be specific to a program if even offered.  And you appear to keep conflating WBEs and MBEs. Yah, civic court is not CSI. Numbers on paper is what they want. Easy to fudge. No I never implied that. I said there is a tax designation for WBE. That's all. You have somehow imagined and argued that I implied all women can become gazillionaires. I don't understand. Here ya go.      
he U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is updating the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes authorized for use in the Women-Owned Small Business Federal Contracting Program (WOSB Program). This update is being made to reflect the U.S. Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) NAICS revision for 2022, identified as NAICS 2022. These changes would impact 85 of the 2017 NAICS codes eligible for use under the WOSB Program. 85 tax codes being impacted. If you're a CPA; do some research and find out for yourself. Damn maybe I should take your job. Lol what. You want a specific federal tax code number. The fact that states have WOB women owned business tax code and regulation means nothing to you?      
You must be a great CPA. Or only work with the Feds. No, there are audits.  Not always effective but you don‚Äôt want the scrutiny. Your first post in the thread spoke of ""many tax advantages"" and implied there are all sorts of handouts.  But you can't list any and seem to keep writing about breaks related to very specific things, like for minority businesses operating in blighted districts or certain government contracts.  

The truth is that beyond certain specific programs in certain states or specific government contracting, there aren't tax benefits, there arent LLC benefits - no idea what California does but the LLC process is the same for all businesses in most states, doesn't matter who the owners are. None of that is a general tax break for women owned business.  Keep trying... If you had some actual knowledge, sure.  So far, you've just posted things about minority businesses and pork projects, nothing about general taxes.  Still waiting. A simple quote of what tax law women owned businesses can use to get these (imaginary) sweet tax breaks would suffice.  Rather than something you think you heard or maybe encountered on a specific local pork project.  Again, women business owners would love to hear about these benefits you think exist, share away. I get that. But let me tell you. I was tasked with finding ""available markets"" for our industry. A city with 35,000.... 35 THOUSAND...licenses across MBE/WBE/VBE.        
If you have the startup cash and documentation, it's done. Followup with your audit or other paperwork in 5 years time if you want. Courts can be delayed. Money will be made, business LLC dissolved and relocated by then. There are many grants available for women-owned businesses in California, including grants that support women entrepreneurs in specific industries.¬†

* **Amber Grant**A $10,000 grant awarded monthly to female entrepreneurs.¬†The grant is open to women with business ideas or who are starting a new business.¬†

General taxes?  Wait. So you wanna move the goal posts now? You're gonna change the whole discussion, claiming you are talking about individual taxes? Gtfo These are straight from the Small Business Administration website. Still waiting to see those many tax laws and LLC advantages you mention that benefit women.  All women, not just California unicorns.  

The grant info will surely help a few businesses though.  So even though it was an attempt to deflect from being called out on your BS about numerous tax and LLC advantages, at least you dug up something helpful if unrelated to what you originally asserted. You're the one that started it with the generalization of ""many taxes"" and other LLC benefits that women were getting. Now it sounds like the truth, which is small local areas or specific contracts.  The only one moving goal posts is you as you keep getting called on the BS.

And yeah, most people reading a board like this don't live in your specific tiny area - they're asking about general taxes. Tax is usually paid after a business makes money. Seeing as these are women businesses its better to offer free money just in case they dont become profitable. It's much better than tax you see You have got to be the worst certified professional in your area. How in the fuck do you make a living, being so oblivious to the laws of your industry? Coming from someone who has yet to cite an actual law, I consider the source.

You once heard a rumor of something and keep spouting it like it's gospel.  When someone calls you on it and asks for some actual facts, you understandably get defensive and start hurling insults.  Not hard to see through.  We're all still waiting to hear about these big tax and LLC advantages you mentioned.  When you can quit having a toddler tantrum and cite actual tax laws women owned business can sue, that would be super. Numerous programs have been listed Yes, nice attempt at deflection.  You found some grants - that is good and will help a few businesses.  Still waiting on all those tax and LLC advantages you claimed in your first post.  Or... you could amend your post to be truthful and state that other than certain very specific state tax breaks for very specific projects or very specific breaks related to very specific federal projects, there aren't tax or LLC advantages for women owned businesses in general (unlike what you implied.)

But you can also keep trying to dig for the unicorns as I'm sure they help someone even though they don't remotely prove what you asserted. Tax exemptions were listed. Which would have been relevant and honest if your original assertion had been ""in very specific situations - like revitalizing blighted areas or for certain government contracts - there are sometimes tax breaks given if a percent of the contracting goes to a woman owned business.""  But you didn't.  You implied general tax and LLC advantages for women.  And when you were called on it, you got nasty.  It says something about you. Ummmmm.  No I did not imply that. I don't know why you keep saying Los Angeles is a blighted area.   A business license is not a ""very specific situation"". Nor is investment or doing business with that entity.      
If you think State Tax code is too specific for a tax discussion, I don't know what conversation you are prepared for.     
Being told that you are absolutely wrong, is not *nasty*. You have a serious mental deficiency.",2025-01-10 14:06:20

I wanted to share an app idea I‚Äôve been thinking about that could help people struggling with gambling addiction. My goal isn‚Äôt to build it myself or profit from it‚ÄîI simply want to see if someone with the right skills and resources could bring it to life. I truly believe it could make a difference for those dealing with gambling urges.

I‚Äôd love your thoughts, and if you think it‚Äôs worth building, I encourage anyone to take the idea and run with it. I‚Äôd be more than happy to help promote it to anyone I know who‚Äôs battling gambling addiction.

How It Works:

1. Real-Time Reminder
When a user opens a gambling app or website, a full-screen notification appears with a persuasive message like:

""The odds are always against you. Is this really worth it?‚Äù
‚ÄúThink about your goals‚Äîdon‚Äôt let gambling hold you back.‚Äù

There‚Äôs only a Close Notification button (no direct access), forcing the user to pause and dismiss the reminder. If they still want to gamble, they‚Äôll have to reopen the app or site.

2. Reflection Prompts
If a user feels the urge to gamble, the app encourages them to reflect with questions like:
‚ÄúWhat triggered your urge to gamble?(e.g., stress, boredom, peer pressure)""
""How will you feel about this decision tomorrow?‚Äù
""What‚Äôs one thing you‚Äôve achieved recently by not gambling?‚Äù
They can journal their answers in the app, helping them track patterns over time.

3. Productive Alternatives
After reflection, users are offered tailored alternatives to redirect their energy:

Stress Relief:
Quick guided meditations or breathing exercises (1‚Äì2 minutes).
Calming animations or nature sounds.

Boredom:
Fun mini-games (e.g., trivia, puzzles).
A ‚ÄúFocus Challenge‚Äù to brainstorm goals or hobbies.

Financial Motivation:
Savings challenges: ‚ÄúSave $10 today instead of gambling!‚Äù
Visual tools showing potential long-term savings.

4. Financial Tracker

Users can log their gambling expenses and skipped gambling attempts.

A dashboard shows savings milestones and visualizations of what they could afford by avoiding gambling (e.g., a trip or major purchase).

5. Progress and Rewards
Celebrate small wins:
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve gone 14 days gamble-free!‚Äù
""You‚Äôve saved $500 this month!‚Äù
Unlock motivational wallpapers, badges, or quotes as rewards.

Why I‚Äôm Sharing This

I‚Äôve seen people close to me struggle with gambling addiction, and I know how tough it is to break free. I want to create something that gives people a moment to pause, rethink, and regain control‚Äînot by blocking gambling entirely, but by helping them make better decisions on their own.

I‚Äôm not a developer, so I‚Äôm hoping someone in this community sees the potential and brings this idea to life. If you‚Äôre interested, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts.

What Do You Think?
Would this idea work?
If you‚Äôve struggled with gambling yourself, would this app help?
Are you a developer or part of a team who‚Äôd like to build it?

If anyone out there makes this app a reality, I‚Äôll do everything I can to share it with people who need it. I just want to see this exist and make a difference.

Thanks for reading and for any feedback or ideas!","Does this actually solve a problem ? is there actually a market for this ? How do you know any of this would work?  Or really do anything at all. Its a great rehabilitation app which many can use! However you've limited your target auidence. If you could find potential rehab area's that focus on gambling you could sell them a subscription to the app which they can than use to help their clients. Instead of focusing individually, Try focus on selling to a community. On an unrelated basis, if your in need of any graphical help with your idea, Drop me a Dm as i help business's with Logo development, 3D product mockups etc..Let me know if this serve's an interest to you. Actually that's what I'm asking too in this post. What do you think of this idea? I don‚Äôt know for sure if it would work‚Äîthat‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sharing it as an idea. My background isn‚Äôt in psychology, but the concept is inspired by behavioral strategies like interrupting impulses with reminders, encouraging reflection to build self-awareness, and offering alternatives to redirect the urge.

Whether it works depends on testing with real users. I‚Äôm open to feedback or better ideas‚Äîwhat do you think? Thank you for your input. For now I don't have any plan to build the app myself as I have no resources at all including skills. I just want to share it. Is it possible to test the functionality idas before its built?  I might be open to helping you develop it.  But i would like to see if we can do some user testing first. I'm sorry I have no idea at all on how to do that as I have no resources at all including skills. Maybe you can ask on reddit.  Maybe also you can reach out to recovering addicts and maybe even service that provide help for gambling.  Maybe focus on Las Vega s well.",2025-01-10 11:17:20

Hi! Due to so many messages I‚Äôve received from that post, I‚Äôve decided to start a slack community to help each other grow our businesses. It will be free for the people who initially join! I‚Äôll be a",good,hard,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1hy7yz3/how_are_you_making_over_10000_a_month/,"How are you making over $10,000 a month?","Could be from job, business or side hustle ","I sold 3 businesses last year after being in business for 20 yrs. In that time we also bought the buildings that the businesses were in.  

The rental income alone is net to us +$25k/mo. Now my job is going to the mailbox to pick up a check.   I have 2 more business to move to disposition and then I'll be 100% retired. Im 53 and retirement is looking pretty good. One full-time job, one part-time job and a newsletter :)

Of course net income.

I am building an agency plus finishing up a cool tool for newsletters. Hoping to replace the full-time job this year. Combo of consultancy day job and ebook side hustle Consulting with startups and small businesses that need help with operations, team performance management, and hiring. Having just two clients puts me above that. Have 2 games. One is a mobile game (about 2k a month), another one is a PC game (>10k a month). Brand and web design agency. I‚Äôm the only full time then I outsource to contractors. I making roughly $15k a month in revenue and this year plan to scale to $30-40k months. Teaching sushi classes to the public. Every time I look through these threads about how people make their money I realize how ignorant I am to niche online products, services and whatever else you can create and make money on. I appreciate you all for expanding my mind for future business ventures I could pursue.ü´° My wife and I have built a travel agency from the ground up. Profit margins are low but we have a net profit average of $18,000 a month and travel close to three months out of the year. Own an auto repair shop. I make 5x that. My wife and I create and sell digital products, turned it into a membership, added mini courses to supplement and educate our audience that is purchasing our digital products, along with affiliate commissions for the things we recommend and teach how to use. 

Monthly revenue ~$19k-$26k
Monthly expenses ~$4.5k I sell digital products online. DIY craft stuff. I didn‚Äôt realize how great selling digital items were until I started it. It takes me a few hours to put together an item and then it‚Äôs passive income Child care center.  I built it up to 2 locations, owned the properties, sold it all a couple years ago, live on the money I have invested (before I sold, I was making more than 50k a month). I am living on 15k a month right now doing nothing. Starting another preschool biz soon but with plans to expand to many locations and buy some established ones too. I like my semi retirement right now so I brought on a partner to handle daily operations. Goal is 5 schools in the 10 yrs working 10 to 20 hrs a wk. I'm a 50ish woman. üòÅ 50% I work full time as an Electrician in Commercial High rise. 

Also own my own Electrical Contracting business which makes up the other 50% of my income.

Tip: own your own business if you can find any excuse to do so. If Capitalism was a board game, owning capital would be the win condition. I don't but I am eager to learn Combination of job and side business(es). 

I work a remote IT/Security job that pays pretty well and offers strong benefits. I supplement my income with a pretty strong side business doing local IT support, web development, and general security training. Last year I wound the business side down a bit to  focus on moving my family across the country, but the year prior my side business alone brought in over $40k for the year. I‚Äôve personally generated $305K USD in combined revenue from four SaaS products I grew for my clients. It‚Äôs all about focusing on scalable growth, identifying the right audience, and fine-tuning your marketing and sales strategies. Once you nail down those aspects, the money follows. It‚Äôs not magic, it‚Äôs strategy and consistency. I'm not even making 1k/month :( Having your own Business seems to be the only legitimate answer to your question. Finally able to participate in one of these posts üôè Real Estate

Edit: I don‚Äôt flip properties, I‚Äôm an agent Running a design agency, solo and working with contractors (when needed)

While maintaining a marriage with 2 kids.

First year there was no pay-off as anything got reinvested.

Not an answer that people want to hear. Just promote products in exchange for a commission. I‚Äôve made $45K last month. Here‚Äôs how I do it:

- Find a product on TikTok.
- Register for an affiliate account on TikTok Shop
- Request samples from brands and start creating content.
- You don‚Äôt have to show your face
- Tag your affiliate link in your video.
- For every purchase you get 10% - 25% commission
- Once your video gains traction in the algorithm and the company maintains strong inventory control, it can become a ‚Äúset and forget‚Äù system
- Stay consistent to achieve success.

I used to work at a cleaning company for $2K/month. Now I earn enough to buy anything I want travel wherever I want, and take care of my family. Thank God I can‚Äôt complain. I yap on Reddit . 550k rev - 549.99k profit . I wish people like OP would specify gross or net.  Big difference. I'm running a small content marketing company that serves local business, primarily focused on creative production. We only have one client right now and have only done a free gig for them. But hey we just started up!

Also I'm an engineer full time at a rather successful pharma company. Stockmarket

Day-trading -> funds -> long-term dividend port (cash flows $14,000/quarter or $4.6k+/month, this is truly passive now) long-term dividend portfolio value currently about: $700,000. Hoping to get this to cash flow $10k/month next.

Now people don‚Äôt talk about this risk: but you can lock in your dividend rate but the stock can still lose you money. Basically buying a $100 stock with a dividend of $5 (5%) you get your locked in 5% dividend BUT the stock can end the year down -20% or $80/share meaning your total port loses‚Ä¶ this also works vice versa. Saas developer.  100K+ a month. Full time job (12k after taxes, I'm in Growth Marketing) plus startup consultancy (15 - 45k a month pre tax). I charge clients 15k a month and usually have 1 to 3 clients on any given month. 

4 years ago I had 80k of credit card debt and thought about filing for bankruptcy... I guess this is me, I work in tech and make around $200k/yr, so net that brings in about $9k-$10k a month. Also I‚Äôm in the Air Force national guard so that brings in a little extra here and there as well. This year I‚Äôm on orders and getting differential pay (most people probably won‚Äôt know what that means) but because of it I‚Äôm netting $16k/month at the moment. I made a crypto meme coin called dogpoopbutt coin (not that exactly but extremely similar) and its printing me about $120k a month right now. 20+ years running a digital marketing agency¬† I'm a self employed appliance repair technician. Monthly revenue is $16,000-$18,000, and monthly net profit is $10,000-$12,000 depending on the month. I own 24 apartments and houses. Began buying in 2010 when everyone was afraid of real estate. A coffee shop in my town, about 28k per month. Only fans. We are the largest supplier of commercial and custom fans in the Tri-state area. You may have seen our billboards on I-77 along exits 20-40. A full time career and a part-time hustle‚Ä¶healthcare for the career. Cooking in an apron for the side hustle. I own a moving company with 4 trucks. I started 8 years ago when I was 22. Own a gym. Private, local non franchise. Rental property 2 times that amount, my job as a drilling consultant in oil and gas exploration 3 times that. Charging 60-100$ per hour my design services on long term partnerships with US based companies. I am currently in partnership with one CAD ( Computer-aided dispatch) and cyber security company, and we seal our partnership for next 5+ years. Working full time for them as Senior Product Designer remotely from Europe. [deleted] Had a $13k revenue month in December with my print on demand apparel/ gifts Etsy shop! Started it in October 2023.
That was my best month, probably not hitting that this month but looking to make that the norm. 2 businesses. Landscape maintenance, and CRM software for landscapers. I manufacture premium automotive products on CNC machines and automatic presses. I have many smaller products with around $300 net profit in each sale in addition to large products with about $5k net profit in each sale. Products are all my novel designs. Marketing cost is zero. Revenue around $350k, 50% profit margin, zero debt. Replaced all employees with automation. The business is around 30hrs/week, but I spend about another 40/wk in the shop developing future products. I play Monopoly and own Boardwalk and Park Place.  I built hotels through good contractor and charge substantial rent when people visit.  It's easy money.  That's how I make 10K If we‚Äôre talking business revenue. HVAC service business and recently added plumbing. $2m/month avg. 40 service vehicles. Residential only. ~25% EBITDA Paint repairs for car dealers. ~25k a month Ecom store in the gifting space. 100k month rev / 55k month profit I‚Äôm an experienced SME in industrial relations, I make 1200 a day I make sure peoples poop and water keeps flowing. Liquid gold‚Ä¶ Started distributing a niche product that was unavailable in my region. 

Captured most of the market share at that time. Product range expanded and grew with the market. 

Business has scaled quite well and I‚Äôve mostly outsource a lot of my operations to trusted partners. 

For the amount of time I spend on it, it‚Äôs turned out pretty well but I need to review overheads as operating costs have creeped up over the years. I made a SaaS platform and tried to get clients try it in the hopes they would by my services.  
It worked currently making above 12K each month and trying to grow I work in tech for a large S&P 500 as a Software Engineer.  With salary, stock, and bonuses it comes to around 15-17k per month before taxes. Its definitely nice having a great job + stability. However I do miss the creativity and potential rewards of owning a business. I may start something again in the future after building up the war chest. I own a marketing agency. Once client pays me $40k monthly. That‚Äôs my cut We‚Äôre at about ~25k$/mo reve last year as we lost our top client mid year. This year we‚Äôre close to closing a new key client, so we should be at around ~65$k/mo by mid year, maybe bit higher as market is picking up and our network starts to work. Our gross margins are ~28%. After losing top client I cut my pay close to nothing for half a year.
We do software consulting, talent augmentation in tech. We‚Äôre based in Poland, so cost of living is friendlier than in the US. I promote influencers on social media. Makes me around 50k/month. I own a small marketing business - Gotta have the drive and just keep hustling! Health care, do about 10-14 a week gross. Net about 6-9 depending on random expenses. I own a cyber security msp. Medium-sized customers, the money is good, and my schedule if pretty flexible. 

Like the body shop poster I started with being in the field and fixing computers till I got a different type of business. I'm not really looking to grow a lot. Just keep up with inflation. [deleted] Construction PM + Second Job Full time job and freelance business on the side too Social media, newsletter, and throwing raves Right now I'm on a new business so not quite there yet. But I was on over $20k a month doing simulation engineering contracting. Accountant thinking outside of the box.

\*You will give me mun-eeee..... you will give me mun-eeee\* I'm into digital marketing selling courses, and it's a fixed differential income monthly. Ranging from $5-$10k a mo. The courses teach you how to set yourself up to make passive income from your phone  üì± üíØ Sales! At bigger companies if you sell well you can get into ""accelerator"" territory where they pay you out in higher multipliers for commission. My record month ever was 15K - tons of AI and automation. I was a contractor and was able to provide tons of value. I also worked at rate of $56 hour. I also delivered couple of projects to clients - work was outsourced. I'm AI / automation fella and can take a bunch of bullshit off the table from marketing / sales, my web dev is creating custom solutions for successful businesses like wholesellers or manufacturing - b2b facing solutions usually. This 15K was full profit. Never been able to repeat it as customers are super hard to find and good intros are even more rare. 

One of my biggest shadows is looking at those who did not even try and making mils a year, while I'm sweating ass off with reals skills and cant find clients üòÇ. Usual month is 2-5K. Digital marketing. 
1.Charge 150 dollars a month for ads management 
2.Get a package set like a product
3.Run ads for your product 
4.Optimize your ad until it's successful 

Started with 3 new customers a week. Now we close around 7-10 customers a day. About 700-1500dollars a day just within our nation. Planning to expand to the whole world soon to x10 the potential income.

Now we are moving into e commerce. Our team are working on making autonomous funneling channels. 

Make a product out of every business you do. When you turn your business into a product, you can repeated sell it everyday. Potentially grow your team as well as the daily income. You can make a product out of a service based business too. I work for myself.  Pool service I‚Äôm not an entrepreneur but I make $22k/mo from my job. Combined with my wife our monthly income is $42k I have 2 small businesses a computer repair and IT services company and a local marketing agency. We do about 90 -120k per month. 

Computer services started as driving around doing meetups and onsite services for other businesses. 10 years later we have 8 staff. We also retail a bunch of nerdy stuff electronics and computers. 

Marketing agency we started last year and now have 6 staff. The economy in our area is pretty terrible so I‚Äôm thankful that we‚Äôve been able to navigate the ups and downs. I‚Äôm not there yet, but it‚Äôs a big goal of mine. Right now, I‚Äôm building a personal finance brand through YouTube, a newsletter, and social media. The plan is to grow an audience by providing value (like financial tips and advice), then monetize through subscriptions, digital products, and maybe even sponsorships. Job. Just signed an offer for $360k/yr as a cloud sales specialist.¬†

Base salary is $180k, $15k/mo before taxes.¬†

Literally just doubled my income from my previous role.¬† We have a business that operates 98% without our input (net about 100k per month - education business), rental properties ($13k per month before expenses - about $6k free and clear), dividends/interest (about $10k) , and options trading income (about 8-20k per month). I started a construction biz back in 2020. I previously topped out at 40k a year, 2020 did roughly 40k. 2021 I was doing 30-50k a month, and decided to work when I wanted which was a couple months a year.

Fast forward to 25, gross roughly 150k/mo Powerlifting Coaching Spoiler: I'm not. crypto stuff In my dreams at night. ECommerce. Been doing 10k months for almost a decade now. But 10k is a month is low that if I ever just do only 10k, that feels like an absolute failure. 

10k a month once you have systems running is pretty much automated. I sell 0 dte $ndx spreads from a glass house but I‚Äôm two sigma strikes away from the bloodshed. 

My 25k account pumps 1-2k gross per trading day. 

This doesn‚Äôt count my 80%+ winners with swing trades and other 0 dte variants.

38M, SF Bay Area, former AI marketing exec and longtime stock/bullion hustler. I‚Äôm all about that 1256 and 1031 money. If you know, you know. I own an outsourcing company and pay myself $5,000 a month, even though the business makes way more than that. Honestly, it‚Äôd feel crazy to pay myself what the profits actually are.

After we redesigned the website, SEO leads started rolling in, which has really helped us grow. We‚Äôre also getting more traction from attending conferences.

Right now, the company‚Äôs profiting about $60,000 a month, but I think i can hit $100,000 a month by the end of the year.

The business works because we save clients money on staffing, but it also helps that I genuinely care about the employees and try to make it a fun, cool place to work. It keeps everyone happy and engaged.

I'm the same with clients too actually. I'll go out and party with them or start side hustles with them, if we click like that.

It's a great life. I sell digital products, mainly courses. Some are MRR and some are not. So some courses teach people how to make money online and another one teaches people how to grow their business using LinkedIn. I‚Äôm 24 working a 9-5 how do I increase my income to get out of the 9-5? Sucking dicks mainly I do many multiples of that. Own an agency offering SEO, PPC, web design, and social media.

I have tried the digital crap , it‚Äôs rough because so much competition. Last year I was over employed aka I have two full time remote jobs. I was making almost 300k a year. It was laughable. I paid off all our bills except mortgage. A good job, and 18 years in the hospitality industry Just a job - but it's not 10k a month after taxes, healthcare and 401k I had a skill in engineering.  I went off on my own delivering that skill.  Then I hired people and taught them to do things the same way I did.  Then I built processes and culture and behavior to propagate what worked for me and scale it slowly. Then I learned how to do strategic sales by experimenting with pricing and honing value proposition and grabbing a niche here and there when luck brought it my way.  A lot of success in entrepreneurship is capturing luck when it's in front of you.  As profits grew i was able to hire people to do more of my work.  Then I worked toward empowering the team and making myself irrelevant.  Lots of profit sharing, lots of empowering with authority and responsibility for consequences and letting people do it their way instead of my way as long as they agreed to clean up their mess in exchange for the glory in their successes. They no longer need me and it feels weird and cool at the same time (letting go of ego is hard when your business is part of your identity).  The next goal is to help them make themselves rich.

For some, it could be a high-paying job in tech, sales, or consulting combined with side hustles like freelancing or teaching online courses. Others achieve it through businesses, such as e-commerce stores, real estate investments, or running a service-based business like marketing or software development. Passive income streams, like dividends, rental properties, or affiliate marketing, also play a big role in reaching this level. Freelancing in SEO and running a small e-commerce store, diversifying income streams really adds up. - Freelance software dev & designer

üöÄ I‚Äôve been leveraging my expertise to help businesses grow through automation and optimization, which is in high demand right now. Plus, I run a newsletter and a blog that‚Äôs monetized through affiliate marketing and ads. 

üìà If you're looking for a way to hit that $10k/month mark, I‚Äôd say focus on building something scalable, whether it's a service, product, or content. Who else here has cracked the code?

Back in my 20s I did around this amount weekly on eBay (not profit) by drop shipping PRIOR to drop shipping becoming a trend on social media, which gave it a bad name, because people started selling courses complicating the process, also lacking key info on how to do it properly. While grossing 5 figures per week I still kept my minimum wage job because I enjoyed the atmosphere. Good times Virtual companionship 1. found a niche with zero competition
2. built a great product that didn't exist
3. profit

The market I operate in is tiny and extremely specific. I haven't had a single new client in 2024, and only 1 in 2023. But not a single one ever left my product since it was launched, no competition appeared and none most likely will, and the product is helping my customers make big money, so they happily pay my tool for that. My commercial cleaning business, just my reoccurring contracts. I do ""Intrapreneurship"" for an international construction and services company.  
  
Basically they send me to a foreign country, I form a joint venture with a local company, chase after contracts, hopefully win work, hire / train / set up the contracts, and then manage them for client satisfaction and profitability.

Don't make as much as if I was doing it for myself, but have company resources and backing, a steady paycheck (I often say I get paid for the attempt, not to stick the landing), and somewhat less stress then if it was my money on the line.

Take home after taxes, flights, living expenses covered by the company is around $11,000 per month. Got my engineering degree, worked up from intern(started when I was 20) while I was in school to a director over North America. Started college at 18, graduated at 28, cleared $120k at 22. I left the company at 31 when my mom got sick. Put all my savings and 401k ($350k) into a business. That business hasn‚Äôt taken off yet, was years of R&D, might take off this year, I might clear $120k again. I‚Äôm broke, I‚Äôve lived with friends and parents for years, hardly go out to eat.  If the business does what it‚Äôs supposed to, I‚Äôll be a centimillionaire in a few years before I‚Äôm 40. And I‚Äôll take a lot of people up with me as I do Welding. 10k take home every 2 weeks with benefits. I own a bookkeeping company and make that.

I have worked as an engineer for 27 years and my partner is also an engineer.  We invested hardcore in our retirement plans and Roth IRA‚Äôs heavily over the years.

In addition, in our late 20‚Äôs, we bought our first house which was a fixer upper in a great neighborhood.  Then when we had to relocate for work, we sold our first house and did the same thing again, buying another fixer upper.  We are both pretty handy, so we did a lot of the work ourselves.  This gave us two rounds of forced equity increase on our primary homes.

By this time we were in our early 30‚Äôs.  We then took some of the equity from our primary home and bought 3 houses in a 55+ community in FL where we have been renting them out now to seniors for almost 20 years.  Renting to seniors is great as there is very low upkeep and time required.  They pay rent on time, don‚Äôt cause trouble, and are usually pretty easy as far as wear and tear on properties goes.

We also bought 3 more houses over the years and I inherited my parent‚Äôs condo when they died.  We rent all of those out as well, and one of them is an AirBnB that we just started late last year.  We also flipped another house a few years ago in a historic district which was a full gut with some friends for fun and to learn new real estate tricks.

We also tried having a side engineering consulting business for a few years in our late 30‚Äôs where we were doing custom electronics for people, but we had to give that up when our child was born in our early 40‚Äôs.  Was a very good learning experience and we made a little extra cash !   We did this as a side hustle from our normal 40 hour a week engineering jobs at a big company.

We are both in our early 50‚Äôs now, still working full time as engineers at Big Company.  We could retire now if we really wanted to.

My partner is 2 years older than me and they will probably drop down to part time work in the next year or two.  I will probably follow suit in a couple more years.

We used 15 year mortgages as much as we could to gain equity in our properties more quickly at the expense of immediate cashflow and the ability to get more houses.  Our primary house and two of our rentals pay off in 2.5 years and a third pays off in 4 years. When that happens if I go to work part time, we won‚Äôt even notice the difference in salary due to the cashflow from those homes.

We are starting to slow down a little bit now.  I want to enjoy the time I have with my kid before they grow up and leave the house.  I want to go camping more and I want to have more time to volunteer teaching kids.

We live a financially conservative life for the most part.  We have a 6 year old Tesla, a 20 year old minivan, and a 12 year old SUV we bought from friends when it had some major mechanical problems to tow our camper.  No car loans on any of them and we pay our credit card bill every month.  Our primary house is nice, but it is just an ordinary house in a nice suburb.  If you looked at us on the street you would have no idea and I like it that way.

As long as it is still kind of fun, I will probably keep working as an engineer in some fashion for the rest of my life as I enjoy it.  I have gotten lots of patents over the years at my job with Big Company and a couple more on my own and with my dad.

I enjoy real estate and investing as it is a fun game as much as anything else.

Here's from ChatGPT 
SDE (Seller‚Äôs Discretionary Earnings):
Seller‚Äôs Discretionary Earnings is a financial metric used to evaluate a small business‚Äôs profitability by determining the total financial benefit the owner derives from the business. It helps buyers assess the business‚Äôs true earning potential, especially in owner-operated businesses. SDE is calculated as:

SDE = Net Profit + Owner‚Äôs Salary + Discretionary Expenses + Non-recurring Expenses + Depreciation + Interest + Taxes

The SDE adjusts for expenses that are non-essential or unique to the current owner, ensuring the buyer sees the core profitability of the business.

Steps to Analyze a Business You Want to Buy:

1. Understand the Financials:
	‚Ä¢	Review SDE: Focus on the seller‚Äôs discretionary earnings to understand profitability.
	‚Ä¢	Examine Key Financial Statements: Look at profit and loss statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements for at least 3 years.
	‚Ä¢	Trends: Identify revenue, expense, and profit trends over time. Check for seasonality or irregular income patterns.
	‚Ä¢	Debt: Look at existing liabilities and obligations.

2. Assess Market Position:
	‚Ä¢	Industry Trends: Research the market and industry to understand growth potential or risks.
	‚Ä¢	Competition: Analyze the competitive landscape and what makes the business stand out.
	‚Ä¢	Customer Base: Review customer demographics, loyalty, and revenue concentration (e.g., does one customer represent a large percentage of income?).

3. Analyze Operations:
	‚Ä¢	Processes and Systems: Check if the business has established systems, workflows, and standard operating procedures (SOPs).
	‚Ä¢	Staffing: Evaluate the team‚Äôs skills, stability, and reliance on key personnel.
	‚Ä¢	Owner Dependency: Determine how much the business depends on the current owner. High dependency can be a risk.

4. Examine Assets and Liabilities:
	‚Ä¢	Assets: Inventory, equipment, intellectual property, and goodwill should be valued accurately.
	‚Ä¢	Liabilities: Review leases, contracts, loans, or other liabilities.

5. Evaluate Risk Factors:
	‚Ä¢	Legal: Check for pending lawsuits, regulatory issues, or other legal risks.
	‚Ä¢	Contracts: Evaluate vendor, customer, and employee agreements for terms and renewability.
	‚Ä¢	Economic Conditions: Consider external factors like the local economy, inflation, or supply chain vulnerabilities.

6. Valuation and ROI:
	‚Ä¢	Business Valuation: Use SDE multiples (typically 2‚Äì5x SDE for small businesses) or other methods like asset-based or market comparisons.
	‚Ä¢	Break-Even Analysis: Assess how long it will take to recoup your investment.
	‚Ä¢	Growth Potential: Identify opportunities to increase revenue or reduce costs.

7. Conduct Due Diligence:
	‚Ä¢	Verify financials, contracts, and other key documents.
	‚Ä¢	Speak with vendors, customers, and employees (if possible) for insights.
	‚Ä¢	Use professional help (accountants, attorneys, business brokers) to avoid missing critical details.

8. Align with Your Goals:
	‚Ä¢	Ensure the business aligns with your skills, interests, and long-term objectives.
	‚Ä¢	Consider whether the location, industry, and operational scale are suitable for you.

By focusing on SDE and conducting thorough due diligence, you can make an informed decision about whether to purchase the business and at what price. Following I work for the government .

Can we see your agency‚Äôs site? üôè Can you send me your portofilio ? I would love to see the type of websites you build.
Also do you use page builders ? 
Who do you host with ? I would love to see your portofolio. Brand identity designer here with 7 years of experience, i would like to know how do i get leads in this niches as i am struggling and have to do odd jobs. Freelance markets places are saturated now cant get clients. Hi! Due to so many messages I‚Äôve received from that post, I‚Äôve decided to start a slack community to help each other grow our businesses. It will be free for the people who initially join! I‚Äôll be able to answer questions and connect there. 

Here‚Äôs a form for interest: 

https://forms.gle/bk2tHB5kNwt8RL8K9 Dm if you need a professional contractor. My family has hired one of you for a couple of functions - birthday, anniversary dinner...It is a lot of fun. The kids really got into it and we got to eat some amazing, fresh sushi. Not cheap, but well worth it. in person I assume? That‚Äôs so coo! Love your username! When entrepreneurs tell people ‚Äúyou can do anything you want if you put your mind to it‚Äù they mean it. Anything is possible and the biggest obstacle is you. 

You may succeed if you try, but you will 100% fail if you don‚Äôt. This sounds fun actually. In future, I would also love to do something like this. If it's not too much to ask, how would you recommend someone get started in this field? Is not pretty much self serve area in people's lives? Obviously it is not so well done. How long have you been doing it, and what are the trends? How do you acquire customers, anything magical or just going to where your audience is? I‚Äôve been curious about this. Who is your audience? What are the characteristics of people who use travel agents - is it big groups, events? Did you start it yourself? Buy an existing shop? Would love to hear the story on this. Rev? Sure. Profit? No way. How many employees do you have?
And what do you feel are their main struggles? What is your overhead? What kind of digital products? How long have you both been at it and how focused are you on scaling? What tools/platform do you use for that? Im building a course hosting/selling tool and id love any advice Can you teach me That‚Äôs interesting. Could you share your business, either here or in a DM? Am very interested in getting into the event planning space and had some ideas regarding group engagement apps, would love to pick your brain and learn how you guys made it work. What kind of digital items? Where do you sell and how do you market? What kind of digital products do you sell? I'm also interested Expound Are we taking pdfs/images? That‚Äôs awesome! How can we find your store? Also how do you drive traffic? When did you start ? Teach me Did you franchise? I am thinking about opening a daycare in Ontario but I‚Äôve heard a lot of negative views in this business especially since the government caps your daily rate per child if you want to sign up for the subsidy. Would be amazing if you can share an income statement for one of your centers (anonymized of course). Can I DM you, I‚Äôm interested in picking your thoughts about what I‚Äôm working on I'm a union plumber and have been thinking about this. I'll never be my own boss in the union, and they frown upon starting your own business unless you're gonna be a union contractor... Same, I‚Äôm stuck with too many options right now Curious on how you started doing local IT support. How‚Äôd you find clients and what kind of support was it? Wanting to do something similar to help me learn different tools/technologies my company doesn‚Äôt use. How‚Äôd you get into the it/cyber security space I‚Äôve been thinking about it What did the security training offer include? How long did You sell digital productos? Can you please tell the way for it? Brother i have sent a dm Generating revenue with SaaS ain't magic, it‚Äôs more like a science project needing strategy and patience. I grew user engagement using tools like HubSpot and SEO optimization. Planning, testing, and adapting is key. Also, platforms like Pulse for Reddit help engage with communities, adding a layer to marketing strategies. There's a ton of jobs that pay over $120k a year, it's honestly way easier to get one of those than to build a business that you can draw a $120k salary from Employed: capped earnings, low risk, stressful

Self employed: uncapped earnings, high risk, stressful [deleted] I did 200k last year should do around 300-350 this year. Sales job Yes I would agree it seems realistically - have your own business but you established it in the same area as your full time profession. Or you/ you and your significant other put the time into growing sales for some niche product and/or solution. I make >$10k/mo at my job. It‚Äôs a high paying salary, but it‚Äôs by no means impossible. Millions of people in the USA alone have blue and white collar jobs that pay this amount or more. that‚Äôs it. i‚Äôm done with fake estates I don't know much about real estate, my understanding is that you need a lot of capital both to flip houses and rent them out.

Is there any low capital entry? Professional door knob turner and Craigs list poster. Nice. Pretty much what I'm trying to get in. Mind if you can tell me how you get your clients? Or what should be the primary focus for someone starting out? What's the duration it took for you to get where you are? Ha - I'm in the process of starting my agency.

Tik tik affiliate? [deleted] I have 64K followers, can you share with me your content strategy (via dm). May I check out your channel to watch and learn? Well TikTok is about to banned in the US in a little over a week... the chance it will go through is very nearly 100% considering TikTok's stance and the circumstances. What's your plan for after that? Amazing. You are an inspiration üôè What exactly do you mean you yap on Reddit??

From where do you get ideas, which platform do you use to build them and what is your pricing model(Subscription or etc.)?? Will be really helpful if you can answer these.. [removed] After a decade of self doubt I finally started my own SaaS project, I had a conversation with someone who said they were paying ¬£60 a month for a service, but it was shit and they were going to stop using it.  
Im currently midway through my project. I just can't shake that feeling that its simply not going to work. Even though I feel i've found a potential niche, and I know I have the skills to develop it, I keep having this nagging feeling in the back of my head.  
This would be my first attempt at anything like this and to be quite honest its scary!

Do you have any tips or maybe words of wisdom? I feel like creating a SaaS would be my strongpoint but also im not someone who should be doing it, if that makes sense?

Even though I feel like i've found a potential niche, I also can't shake the feeling that my product simply won't live up to the competition. Its just a total lack of confidence I guess, but Ive become quite motivated reading other peoples experiences and you certainly seem to be in a position I dream of daily so I would really appreciate any advice. What are you consulting for? [removed] i‚Äôve always been intrigued by Tech and IT jobs / education. If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, what did you study? What job are you currently doing?

I see what u did there Nobody needs your service. These women can be their own boss. Why would they need someone to represent them That‚Äôs probably over 50k then no? USA? Hey I was wondering if I could DM you about this if that‚Äôs alright? I was interested in doing this and had some questions. [deleted] This is something I was thinking of getting into. I've got a background in full stack web dev so it wouldn't be a drastic change in skill set. The more I read about it though, the more it seemed that the general consensus is that most people who bug hunt make very little money doing it and that it was not worth the effort.

Of course that could just be a result of sour grapes from people who tried and couldn't hack it (pun intended). In any case, it was hard to get an accurate read on just how much a full time bug hunter could make. Would you say that your experience is closer to the norm or is it rare to make that kind of money in it? Do you use AI for the design? [deleted] How did you get into landscape maintenance?

|-|-|-|-| !RemindMe 7 days [deleted] [removed] wht do u do with ai lol can you help me? Make something cool [removed] I like to see what is working for people ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The same dumb jokes and complaining about the threads bother me more than seeing similar questions asked. And I‚Äôm interested so hush, if you don‚Äôt like it keep going. üö™ Maybe limit to once a month That's not a ""how."" one of his tips is trading crypto lol You ‚Äúfound it‚Äù haha, you didn‚Äôt even bother to use a different profile picture. I keep on telling my self one day. I'll actually be there I don't think it really matters, though at the same time I'm interested in it tooüòÇ. Ok.  Here is some advice.  In the disposition of these companies, of which I owned one for 12 years, a restaurant, and the other aesthetic beauty business...think botox, laser hair, facials etc. for 20 years, all the buyers asked me for 3 years tax returns, 3 years of P&Ls.  

Keep this stuff organized.  Get a CPA that knows how to talk to banks, investors etc.  Don't find the cheapest or just a bookkeeper and don't do it yourself unless you are an actual CPA. 

This goes for getting bank financing etc.  In order to have ""Access To Capital"" you have to be ""Capital Ready"".  This means that you have to have your books in tip top shape.  

What helped me was getting bank financing for the real estate.  I realize it was cheaper to buy than to rent especially multi-tenant buidlings because the other tenants pay the mortgage plus.  The banker pulled me aside and told me in 2017, ""your business are growing, and you need to make sure this information is order because that is what banks look for"". Prior to this I just had a bookkeeper.  He advised me to get a CPA to work with the banks.  It turns out that the work the CPA did for the banks was exactly what the potential buyers were asking for.  Quarterly I had to submit to the real estate lenders P&L's for the businesses within to show we had enough cash flow for continue.   And because I locked this down, when we decided we wanted out, the buyers at the table where looking at exactly at what the bankers wanted.  And because I had these being done quarterly, I didn't have to go backtrack to create these.  Everything lined up perfectly.   That data should match your POS or CRM systems.  

Consider those you as you would consider putting product in a display case.  It should clean, organized and have a spotlight shining and highlighting your business.  

I've been very blessed but going back knowing this, I would start a business, keep it for a max 3-4 years and move on from there.  The money is made in the disposition of the business asset.  The revenue it generates weekly or monthly should get you by from Day 1 to disposition.   

Hire the best. You will make less money in the short term but in the long run it will pay off and give you time to focus growth or just travel.   

Get involved in your local politics at the city council level.  Especially if you involved in commercial real estate.  You can get so much done with permits, variances and waived fee's etc by doing this. 

I say I will retire at 53 but now that I know what I am doing, Ill probably just keeping doing it over and over.  One of the companies I started 1 year ago still has to be seasoned and marinated for a couple more years, then wash, rinse and repeat. Cuz he‚Äôs lying I disagree.  This subreddit is full of posers and people fishing for content for their business blogs.

Actually finding real and unique answers like this is great. I disagree, sharing about a specific business that you would likely not duplicate isn't interesting, but a broad accessible strategy that is successful for a broad cross section of business IS useful.  Starting a business, buying a building and renting it to yourself and eventually renting it to the buyer of your business has been a prolific strategy.  it's especially potent for lifestyle businesses that otherwise may not sell for enough to produce a retirement next egg while the building can produce long term income.

Many of my retired friends are retired because of this strategy not because they had their business for a decade.  A couple of them are trying to sell their buildings as they became boat anchors LOL.

In any case the least productive thing you can do is shit on someone's story that they share with you.  If you didn't like it, move on. How long did it take you to build your newsletter to become profitable? I myself am thinking of creating a newsletter respectfully, in commercial real estate, unless it's class A office space tenants manage renovations repairs and updates unless it is negotiated up front as tenant improvements for a long term lease.  In a standard triple net lease the landlord isn't involved except for collecting checks.  Tenant pays taxes, insurance, and maintenance.  If a water line breaks, and HVAC goes out it's the tenants responsibility.  That's just how it is.

Learn about commercial real estate before criticising someone. Im listening... I own a bar and an online training program. I'm not involved in the day to day operation of either.  The bar can be sold now,  the other need s a few more years to show a track record of revenue. Going the mailbox is just a figure of speech. That's a cool industry!  
My tool is still in dev mode.

It's mostly to help newsletter creators with the following:

\- Helps with keeping your newsletter out of the promotion tab or spam.  
\- Gathers up-to date news to help you think out your content.  
\- Grammar, vocab and real-time suggestions as you write it out.

Open to hear pain points from creators when writing their newsletter. One way is to have sponsors pay for ad placement. If you write articles showcasing a service or out product the owner can be charged based on your reader or viewer feedback. Highlighting a business or person odd another way to generate money or charging others to design and create a newsletter for them. 
Checkout Fiverr.c o m Your expenses is just the monthly fee to your provider (Beehiiv, Kit etc).

You can earn money through sponsors on the newsletter, affiliate links, selling your products, and offering a paid subscription.

I like to use¬†[Beehiiv](https://www.beehiiv.com/?via=Degen-Den).

Right now, I am only doing sponsors in the wake of netflix and onlyfans, there is greater market acceptance of monthly subscription models in the $10-20 range. Tie that together with interest-based algorithms where you don't see content from followers you follow, and you have a resurgence in people subscribing to e-mail newsletters from creators they want to follow.

There's platforms like substack and Patreon, which really are about subscription-based newsletters, then more modern mailing platforms like beehiv facilitate ease-of-sponsorship. Beehiv was founded by some of the guys on the morningbrew team, who were building out a bunch of tools for what was one of the first big daily e-mails... then they built a platform.

There's also a category of newsletters doing high price / high value industry newsletters. The one example that comes to mind is the Van Trump newsletter, which is $6k/year and focuses on the business/investment of agriculture. My First Million did an interview with the founder (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lnS07jjcw4&ab\_channel=MyFirstMillion), which is an interesting watch. By hosting sponsors on the newsletter. You can also put affiliate links, sell your products, and offer a paid subscription.

I like to use [Beehiiv](https://www.beehiiv.com?via=Degen-Den) They know :) but it's not required as long as you do your 8 hours btw I run [https://www.degenden.co/](https://www.degenden.co/)

A crypto Newsletter. [Beehiiv](https://www.beehiiv.com?via=Degen-Den) is pretty easy to use :) 

We can have a chat elsewhere if you'd like, but I have been in the Email marketing space before so nothing new pretty much. A Crypto Newsletter called [DegenDen](https://www.degenden.co/) I am using¬†[Beehiiv](https://www.beehiiv.com/?via=Degen-Den) [DegenDen](https://www.degenden.co/).

You can earn money through sponsors on the newsletter, affiliate links, selling your products, and offering a paid subscription. (I am only doing sponsors right now) Agency for newsletter owners. What's yours? No idea what's that? Laws and norms will be different depending on which part of the world you live in.

I know people that worked 2 full-time jobs (day and night shifts), never had an issue as well. Educational guides in hyper specific niches Combo of Amazon ads, newsletters, FB ads Each of the niches I sell into has their own website. Some books are sold through Amazon/Ingram Spark, some are PDF instructional guides that can be downloaded directly. 

I advertise through Amazon, Facebook and have been building up email lists through newsletters for years. Email list funnel to landing pages. I think having your own lists/landing pages is much more valuable. Not a dumb question at all - if you don‚Äôt ask you don‚Äôt learn and I‚Äôm happy to answer any serious question. 

I do both.  I sell via Amazon (and Ingram Spark) and I also sell directly accessible PDFs. I‚Äôll second this. Can‚Äôt wrap my head around why anyone would desire this when you could ai learn or custom book yourself instantly, or watch YouTube to learn for free. Must be a big offer/ promise or older audience. 1If you are to be successful, you must be willing to put in the effort equivalent to a free internship. Nothing impresses more than someone who works diligently. Well, I generally come in at least fifteen minutes late, ah, I use the side door - that way Lumbergh can't see me, heh heh - and, uh, after that I just sorta space out for about an hour. I also do this kind of consulting work but more towards people trying to navigate the legal and medical requirements for opening up TRT/Medical Weightloss clinics in tough states like California, typically you get good at business either through experience or lots of college or a combination of both, have proof of concept, P&L's, successful exits, resume. Then you just offer your services to people looking for what you know and pitch them. I don't charge hourly. Depending on the scope of work my specific fees vary, and I typically charge either a project-based rate, a monthly retainer, a success fee (for recruiting), or a combination of. There are trade-offs to both. Finding clients is time consuming and not always easy and paying for your own health insurance is expensive, among other challenges. The upside is that you do have more flexibility and get to make all the decisions. Most of my business comes from connections or word of mouth. I help founders who are either first time managers or don't have time for management to set up the right training, systems, processes, tools, talent acquisition/development, and customer experience programs so that they can increase profitability and, hence, scalability and resilience. Would like to more about this and how they help with operations consulting too. I had a company who wanted to hire me full time and turned them into my first customer, then I found my other first couple customers through my network. Most customers since have come from either networking in the industry I specialize in (bitcoin) or through client referrals. I'm not a game designer; I'm a developer. I got into game development by making Unreal Engine tutorials on YT, which were key to getting my first job. After working for several years, I gained many skills and experience and founded my own studio. Just search for ‚Äúgame design‚Äù on udemy, take a highly-rated course for like 10 bucks, and get started!

I‚Äôm not a game dev btw, but this applies to almost any computer / online skill. Is there a specific community you joined to network with other marketers or do you simply reach out to individuals you come across? What kind of leads / businesses? Advertising? Thanks for sharing [trends.co](http://trends.co) and the vault, will add them to my list of content to read. I also work in marketing but have not developed a ""niche"".How would you recommend one develop a niche around content strategy? Is this dejavu? I read this exact same response a couple days ago? Please tell me I‚Äôm not crazy One is called Marble Clash (mobile one) and another is Furnish Master (PC on Steam). What exactly do you mean? The game is paid, so I get money when people buy it. Depends on a game. If it is a small game, then it could be done under couple of thousands dollars (considering Pakistan salaries and not very expensive/experienced team members). It depends on the game. Mobile game income comes from ads; PC game income comes from sales. One is called Marble Clash (mobile one) and another is Furnish Master (PC on Steam). One is called Marble Clash (mobile one) and another is Furnish Master (PC on Steam). I tried to advertise Furnish Master on Meta, but Twitter performed much better, so I kept using it. 

Our publisher also works with Meta to purchase ads for the mobile game, but I'm not really sure if they still do. Once they told me that Meta became much worse for purchasing ads for mobile games. One is called Marble Clash (mobile one) and another is Furnish Master (PC on Steam). Around $11k into Furnish Master (not including my time) and zero into Marble Clash, since our publisher invested in it. However, in total, we spent around $100k on salaries for Marble Clash before the release. I would recommend putting marketing in first place, testing your ideas first, start with smaller games. In other words, make it as a business, not as something ""you dream of"". Many indies fail because they make games they want to play, not what people want to play.

I did Twitter ads, Reddit posting, also worked with PR agency to reach out press and influencers. One is called Marble Clash (mobile one) and another is Furnish Master (PC on Steam). One is called Marble Clash (mobile one) and another is Furnish Master (PC on Steam). Unfortunately, I do not have a tutorial. For my PC project, I handled everything with the help of outsourcing. Currently, I work on this project with one QA who also helps me with community management.

As for our mobile game, I started making a prototype back in 2020 with my partner, who is responsible for visuals, and our game designer friend. After six months of development, we started looking for a publisher and eventually found one. Right now, there are seven of us who work on our mobile projects.

If you want to make your game, I would suggest finding related communities first, such as the HTMAG Discord server about PC game marketing and some game engine community of your choice to learn about the technical side of games. Google is also your best friend, along with ChatGPT or any similar AI. No. One is called Marble Clash (mobile one) and ankther is Furnish Master (PC). Hey I got a business idea would you want to at least hear it out Have a good reputation to get referrals and know clients already from working in the industry for some time. Almost no one hires blind from something a Google search. It‚Äôs a word of mouth industry since it‚Äôs hard to find people or companies that actually deliver amazing results as promised. If hey fail or under-deliver, it falls back in the person who said ‚Äúyes‚Äù, so people are wanting vetted, certain results. Would love to know this as well. Pm if you need a professional web designer & developer.

https://forms.gle/bk2tHB5kNwt8RL8K9 Mostly. Some online, some public classes and some house parties/corporate. My big $$ comes from universities & sororities If you are looking to become an agent, find a local agency that will help train you. If you want to own your own business, a franchise is the quickest way to having a ready made business if you have the capital to invest but you can also bootstrap it through a host agency, which acts as a broker for your travel. To get started, I'd recommend reading through the articles at hostagencyreviews dot com, which gives a good run down of your options and they have honest reviews and advice for travel agents. Not for some. There are a variety of customer profiles, but the two primary profiles are those who have money but little time to plan all the details of a vacation, so instead they describe what their preferred travel style looks like and some of what they are looking for and we put it all together. We use trusted destination experts that use a curated list of companies in every country so that, for example, we send people to hotels that aren't undergoing renovations or currently under bad management or if a private car service is used that the company has the ability to accommodate our guests when a car breaks down or a driver gets sick. We handle all the worrying so they don't have to and are as hands on as requested.

The second primary customer profile are those that are not comfortable handling all the details on their own. They need some hand holding.

People can spend dozens of hours planning trips and not everyone wants to do that, just like not everyone wants to make their own gourmet meal and would prefer to go out so they can just enjoy the experience rather than slaving at the store finding obscure ingredients and watching YouTube to figure it out, only to realize you messed something up because of something you didn't know. Do you want to show up for your trip only to find out that because of your DUI when you were young and dumb you can't enter the country you planned your trip to? That sort of thing happens all the time.

We focus on the harder stuff, mainly because that's where the money is. We don't just sell flights or a trip to Dallas, we will design a custom trip to Europe, an expedition trip to Antarctica, an African Safari adventure, the ultimate trip to Disney world, or a cruise to anywhere. We deal with the extraordinary adventures or just handle the details to the fairly ordinary where the unknown devil may be.

Edit: Finishing up your questions, we've been in the business 10 years and one of our agents has been in it much longer. The trends have been people moving towards travel agencies and the industry has been growing. That said, I think with AI growing, many segments of our industry will shrink. For example, there are currently many agents that just sell all inclusives amny of those agents will go away as it is becoming easier for self service to choose a property and time to go and more and more properties are now able to sell direct to consumers in the US. The good ones will have their business grow, but the order takers are likely to lose out. Be where your customers are when they go to look, is the foundation of our marketing. We have strong local reviews that we built up over time which is a huge help with local SEO and we maintain several Facebook groups focused on different destinations and travel styles. Beyond that, personal offline referrals are very helpful. It took us a few years to build our book of business, build our team, and learn to focus on the most profitable clients who produce the least headaches. We still get the occasional person that books a trip and has a new question, everyday, for a year, but we've learned to weed most of those out on the front end. Big groups are definitely one of our customer profiles. We focus on leisure travel, simply because it's a lot easier to get excited for everyone about an adventure than it is to be excited about a company event in Dallas. We used to do destination weddings but pulled out of that during COVID as we were just sick of the Bride and Groomzillas that had zero chill. We did well in that space, but no thanks, we need our mental health.

Many agencies do cover meetings and events but we rarely do so, unless it's an existing client asking us and then we'll put in the work. Also, destination weddings are huge in certain parts of the country and some agencies only focus on destination weddings.

I mention our two primary customers bases in another comment under my original comment, which are those who are quite capable of doing it all themselves and can afford a nice vacation but would rather someone else work out the details based on their preferences and pass off the hours of planning and worrying about the details and whether or not that amazing resort will be under renovations when they arrive.

The second big grouping are the clients that lack the comfort or experience to travel on their own. There tends to be at least one worrier in the group.

Many others just prefer to have a second set of eyes on their vacation to check their plans. It costs them nothering extra with us, so why not? You would be surprised how many little mistakes people make and we often end up with devoted customers after they realize their little mistakes would have caused major disappointments on that once in a lifetime vacation to _____.

We keep our clients happy by being very selective with the products we offer. I'll never sell a cut rate vacation that could end up with my clients being up the creek without a paddle. We also keep our clients happy. Almost every travel product we sell comes with 24/7 support directly from the I destination support team which means we get to sleep and hear about it later, and focus on sales and prevacation support rather than rerouting people during a transportation strike or finding them a hospital when they break a leg (this just happened with one of our clients and they had support all the way to the airport termanl getting home). Started myself doing a ""mobile mechanic"" type thing. It sucked, I hit a hard ceiling revenue wise and couldn't see a way through it. Was doing $20k on the road but the investment to bring on other guys would've been huge. The shop has allowed me to keep a lot of that customer base but do 5 times the revenue in month. Was the best decision I made. 

I'm almost at a point that I've outgrown this shop and would love to start looking at a bigger place but I have a couple years left on the lease and will just try to max this place out. 

I looked at buying other shops but they were all kinda dark and ratty. Your typical hole in the wall type shop. My shop is modern, bright and clean. We offer a premium service and I want my customers to feel that when they come in. That is profit after paying myself and my 3 staff and all COGs. We average $100k a month at a 50% margin. It's a 120k salary basically, how tf is that unrealistic? With wages and everything around $35k a month. Pre-made and strategized social media content for a particular niche. Event party scripts, customer group engagement content, story content sequence, all the way to e-books and guided and eventually started doing courses and building a full value ladder. We‚Äôve been doing it since 2019. Started part time, and replaced my income after 2 1/2 years. We‚Äôve been full time in our business for the last 3 1/2. I have a woocommerce store that provides a more traditional add to cart, clickfunnels 2.0 for sales funnels and our courses (sometimes Stanstore for funnels or a quick sales page), Kajabi for our membership (want to migrate this, but man that‚Äôs a pain when you have a paying members) and sometimes I‚Äôll just embed a product in Kit that we use for our email distribution Ive got a link in my profile. I‚Äôve got a free class that starts Monday. Porn I sell on etsy and my ""link in bio"" shop. I market on etsy, tiktok, instagram, and youtube I sell tutorials for different craft items Tutorial videos and PDFs I don‚Äôt like posting my personal info on Reddit but I can answer questions. I drive traffic through Etsy, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook. I spend a ton of time on social media marketing and I have a few hundred thousand followers on IG and TikTok. It took a while to get to the place where I have loyal followers/customers. They‚Äôre always excited to see what I come out with next I started 4 years ago. It wasn‚Äôt until this past year that I started making a lot Same as you! In Ontario as well, I am also worried about labor shortages‚Ä¶ id love to run the place but not work in it. 
Hope OP give us more insight Start exploring by having your own business on the side and slowly develop it up and build a client base through word of mouth and ses what marketing works. This, i think, is a good risk based approach to dip your toes in something your own and control, while also not putting you at great financial risk because you still have a steady salary from your existing job. 

It's tough at the beginning managing two at once as you would ezpect, but if you can juggle and eventually figure out how to balance, the outcome will be worth it because you'll find yourself with your own business with steady work and made the transition with minimal financial risk. Yeah but there is no way of knowing when you start, and if they ever catch wind of it you‚Äôre most likely doing good enough to not worry about them. Assign them all a number between 1 and 100 and ask a stranger to pick a number. Whichever one it‚Äôs closest to, start with that! What kinda opinions you say? In two different locations, I found a non-profit that needed help and that ended up setting off a chain of network reactions locally. Working with their boards naturally lead to opportunities to other organizations that needed support or had technical questions I could answer. Getting reliable, knowledgeable help is hard for these organizations and they don't want to waste their money or time if they can help it. 

Engagements have included:

\- Network management and installation

\- Website development

\- Offering free tech workshops, which opened up paid for one on one lessons or in home visits.  
  
Working with the non-profits too, I would offer free residential services with an encouraged donation to the non-profit so there was opportunity to give back to the community. My path:  
  
Help Desk -> Jr. Web Dev -> Network Engineer -> Security Engineer -> Security Architect -> A little bit of everything. I ran private trainings on PowerShell automation with M365, developing security metric's programs, and conditional access training. 5 years Dream bigger . 120k (pretax) is peanuts, especially when you work for a dog for it. I‚Äôd rather make a half million in a year and take the next 2 years off. Building a business is ‚Äúhonestly‚Äù not easy, you‚Äôre right.

If you‚Äôd started your own company, you‚Äôd never say it‚Äôs easier to work for someone else 40 hrs a week and never realize your true value. If you‚Äôre not able or willing to start your own company then makes plenty of sense to just take what your given and be happy. But after tax it‚Äôs not 120k per year. That is true however there is a third option that I have found easier and more profitable that many people don‚Äôt consider. The third option is buying an existing business. I have bought numerous existing businesses and cash flow from day one. Make some updates/changes, and profit increases nicely.¬† But you can not scale that 120k job. You can work your ass off and they still pay you 120k. Self employed is WAY more stressful. Employed is
Non stressful by comparison Is self employment more risky than working for someone who can fire you at any time for any reason? [removed] What you do exactly? Help me Hell yeah. I just signed an offer for $360k/yr for a cloud specialist sales role.¬† Yeah what do you do, exactly? Are you a higher-up in sales, and where should I look to apply for cyber security sales positions? What can you recommend for someone venturing into sales? Or wants to learn That‚Äôs good, but wow I would hate to see how much money you‚Äôre making your company . Enjoy God I would hate to see how much money you are netting your company üò≠ Dad? Add in professional yapper and you‚Äôre not a million miles off Depends on your state‚Äôs requirements [deleted] It's a rolling snowball man. Sell some, create more (invest profits) sell more, create more, sell more and on it goes.

I used to wonder how a thriving business owner could have no free cash on hand. Your profit goes up, margins improve, systems get better but you just grow without a large reward, perhaps growth stalls this year? I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs not going to happen in the near future. It will likely be an on-and-off case for a while and will probably either get dropped or sold to companies like Amazon. Until then, I‚Äôll continue to be an affiliate and earn every last penny I can. You need at least 5,000 followers. I have 56K Thanks man! Yes! TikTok Shop affiliate If you type TikTok Shop in the search bar, you will see tons of videos going viral. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs not going to happen in the near future. It will likely be an on-and-off case for a while and will probably either get dropped or sold to companies like Amazon. Until then, I‚Äôll continue to be an affiliate and earn every last penny I can. Thank you . I‚Äôll DM you my venmo info . I'm pretty sure they're taking the piss but I might be wrong. Best I can do is sell you a course on how to ask for donations on Reddit . That‚Äôll be $1000.00 champ where do I send the invoice . Only part time , I scale that time to 100x tho, scaling course coming soon. I mean I literally started the business last month, but for right now while the business grows I'll do the marketing/business work in the evening and on the weekends.

I'm also finishing my MBA right now, so I guess I'm not sleeping till 2026 Last year was 16% dividend payouts on initial investment. Overall portfolio ended the year up 70% ytd. There are two of us.  I generally don‚Äôt share my products as an attempt to maintain my privacy.  More than willing to provide verification tho. I‚Äôve been writing software and running little businesses for a long time.  This particular business I‚Äôve been working on for about 4.5 years . I keep a running list of ideas that I get from friends, family, conversations with other business owners, research into existing businesses that are working etc.  My piece of advice here is that if you are building your first business, and your goal is to make some additional passive income copy something existing that‚Äôs working.  The business model changes on a case by case basis - subscriptions are good if you have decent retention and retention is a hard problem.  I don‚Äôt have a specific platform that I use.  Generally Ruby on Rails and React/React Native running on Heroku, or Fly. I‚Äôm hacking on 4 right now - but only 2 are actually making money.  One of my apps makes the majority of it.  The other one I‚Äôm still getting started. Also - a big chunk of success is just staying in the game.  Especially if you‚Äôre in a niche with a bunch of new players.  Most will flame out after 6 months.  Some will stick around a year or 2.  Very few will make it to 5.  If you have something that‚Äôs working at all, and the audience is large and especially if it‚Äôs growing - just being stubborn will get you pretty far. I‚Äôve felt like that more times than I can count.  Gotta use it as motivation to do your best work.

Some more tactical advice.  Try to get the strongest signal that you can as soon as possible.  If you think no one will pay start charging for your product.  It‚Äôs the only way to know for sure.  People not paying doesn‚Äôt mean your product is dead on arrival.  If they make it all the way through the funnel and stop at the paywall - maybe it‚Äôs too expensive or you need to add more features.  On the flip side people paying also doesn‚Äôt mean your product will work.  If you can get people to pay then calculate your CAC/LTV ratio.  Ideally it would be at or above 2 - but anything at or above 1.5 is workable.  At all stages measure and a/b test to move your funnel in the right direction. All things RevOps and Growth Marketing. Basically, 1 is how to build efficient processes for early (and not so early) stage companies so that you can generate more revenue and 2 is just about generating more revenue Maybe for a few years, targeting VP of Growth/CRO position out of principle and will probably need to stick for a while just to have that checkmark ü§£
 
Not because of the money, but because I am truly good at it. just the ego thing, you know? Plus, I like my job. Net. Welcome to taxes lol also I max my 401k so didn‚Äôt account for that. Enlisted. I do cybersecurity in the guard. Haha No. Just from selling the coin pretty much. I've been selling it in small increments relative to token liquidity as to not spook the market but I made like a 15,000x on it. Have owned like 20% of the token since launch and it's now in the 8 figure market cap range. The business is a little over a year old, the first 6 months was mostly work for home warranty companies. Now I have two appliance sales businesses in the area who don't have a service department handing out my info when people call them for service, and in return I send all my clients that need new appliances their way. Ever since both sales places started handing out my info, I dropped all 3 warranty companies completely. There is no qualifications or certifications needed for what I do. I was an auto mechanic for 7 years, and that is where I learned all the skills. I'm assuming by your statement that you live in a high cost of living area. Where I live 10k monthly is absolutely killing it. When I was a tech for someone else, I would net about $2,000 per month, so I easily 4x what I was making. I bought a nice 2,400 sq ft house in a great area for $250,000 if that helps put it in perspective. I messed around with pricing and am at the absolute most I could charge right now; I changed the structure 3 times last year until I could feel it was in the right spot. I do plan on scaling, I am about to buy a business condo, and hire my first technician this coming summer if all goes as planned. I would like to have 3 locations in separate markets with several techs and an office person for each. I have talked to others in the business who are at that point already, and I should be able to net $40,000-$50,000 yearly off a tech working for me.

Aside from those details, being my own boss is invaluable to me. I will never collect a bi-weekly paycheck from someone else ever again. I was an auto tech for 7 years, and I learned that by just starting as a tire and lube changer, then worked my way up to technician. I switched to appliance repair after that, and just applied at a local appliance sales company that did service as well. I worked there for 1.5 years and then branched off on my own once I saw how much they charged and how much I was being paid. I hire a manager for the apartments. The original purchase price was leveraged about 75% but now they are almost paid off which is why there's so much cash flow Is that before or after expenses No, delicious Revenue about 120k per month on average. Profit around 15k. Yes yeah thats fine. So I started in with 13k I had saved up in college. Signed a 1 year lease on a crappy space and bought a bunch of used equipment. It wasn't pretty. But I didn't care because I had a place to work out. 

I basically just kept trying to level up and stretch myself just a little too thin with every upgrade. 3 different locations and 100 % new custom equipment. 

Start in 2018 revenue went like this. 

2018 - 12k
2019 - 35k
2020- 78k
2021 - 120k
2022 - 155k
2023 - 219k
2024 - 320k

I invest about 80k this year, so my taxable income will likely be much smaller than 10k a month. But I financed it. 

Hope this helps. No courses. Just blind fucking optimizum. No, I think it looks bad. My text designs sell the best, in trendy fonts! Facebook groups, paid ads. The software is free to use. https://app.houseofyards.com I suppose solving problems and designing parts is a big part of who I am. I feel like I work 30 hours a week. The rest is fun. I guess I have adapted to capitalizing financially off my hobbies. I make stuff for fun, then I put the work in to refine it for manufacturing, build the tooling and fixtures to mass produce it then run automated production. 

You ever meet one of those old retired guys who has muscle cars, offroad toys and fixes everybody's shit in thier home machine shop for fun? That's me, only I'm not old or retired and my shop is 8500 sq ft with cutting edge machines and a 1500sq ft Automotive bay with lifts.

I'm pretty happy with where I'm at. I don't ""work"" 70 hours a week. [removed] Yes residential tends to have higher gross profit and net margins. Residential is also more valuable when it comes time to sell the business as the risk is lower due to thousands of customers making up the revenue instead of dozens. With commercial a single GC or project can make up a large portion of the annual revenue. Additionally, residential companies have annual service memberships which are very valuable when selling to private equity. That‚Äôs revenue. We operate around 50%-55% gross profit which ends up being about 25% EBITDA (profit). I took over the business when it had $700k in revenue in 2014. I sold in 2021.  So about 7 years to get to the point of selling. The main driver in growth was branding. Rebranded with an eye catching logo and vehicle design. Had all the vehicles wrapped with beautiful van design. Bad ass website, billboard designs. Etc. heavily invested in marketing. Grew our service memberships to about 4k customers for recurring revenue and sales opportunities.

Customer acquisition cost of about $300. Average system sale of $15k. Average closing rate of 45%. Once you have those metrics you can almost determine your revenue by marketing spend. It‚Äôs just an average. A lot of the work is outside so it changes during the winter months. Winter months I‚Äôll make 15-20, rest of the year is like 25-35. I probably spend about a grand a month on expenses. It‚Äôs a cheap business really. No employees. I started working for a company about 10 years ago. They taught me how to do everything. I bought the business a few years later and already had clients. Only employee quit so I‚Äôve just been doing it all. Only about 30 hours a week not too bad Physical! We ship internationally but primary US. Maybe 5% of orders are international. Looking to figure out international expansion this year. Find the specialist skill set that interests you, get some experience, and work your way up. 
Specialist IR/ER is a good niche Can i dm you? Kinda. I operate via a PTY LTD I‚Äôd have to look, don‚Äôt know off the top of my head. Revenue last year was just shy of $3m. Standard 40ish hours. My work is primarily project/ task based so as long as I get my work completed within a reasonable time frame everyone is happy. Its not the kind of job where you clock in. Im currently in a hybrid role which requires me to be in office 50% of the time. I honestly dont mind this as I like my co-workers, its good to get out of the house, and the office has free snacks and events. Yes please! That would cost you 50k Yes to smaller influencers. We also help those who are not yet monetizing to put together and launch an offer. Also the vast vast majority of those with substantial audiences could be growing wayyyy faster if they just used the right methods. There is a lot more that can be done then just posting 1-2 reels per day on your IG account. Also one thing to note is that pretty much any influencer with a huge following has more people than just them involved in the backend. Very few 1M+ follower creators are working solo. We take a % of revenue generated by their offer. We also help them create and operate whatever their offer is. Simple example: say you have a fitness influencer with 100k followers on IG who posts 1-2 reels per day and has affiliate codes to gear in their bio.

We will have them send us all their content, then we will repurpose it across all other platforms besides instagram. We will also create multiple related IGs for them to scale even more on IG. 

Then we will replace their lousy affiliate codes monetization with something custom. A course, program, or branded product. We will funnel traffic from all platforms to this offer, and take a % of top line. Answered Answered Just answered. Happy to answer any other questions. Be open to learning. Certainly pick a lane as you are just getting started. Many marketing experts (myself included) often times turn on many services at once, but I found most success when I picked a lane. Do you want to be an expert in design, website building, SEO, email marketing, advertising, social media - I‚Äôd pick one or two and learn it to the best of your ability. Watch YouTube videos (find the experts in the industry), study, take free online courses, but I‚Äôm telling you that you can learn just about anything these days on YouTube. You just have to be open to online learning. While it‚Äôs so easy to do, not everyone has the drive to do it, but it really is right at the tip of your fingertips. Just gotta do it!

One you learn the skill, get your first client (don‚Äôt count out door to door sales) and work your butt off getting that client good results - I mean over work until they are getting results. Use that client as a case study and duplicate that process over and over and over again. No run a Medicaid program for Adults with IDD tech sales! i recommend it for anyone who can talk to clients looking to make large software investments. 40/week as a PM. more like 36-38 as I leave early Fridays. Salary 120k + year end bonus.

I also serve as a lead pastor and I am compensated 750/month. 

I work around 15-20 hours for the second job. I didn‚Äôt, just wound it down significantly to focus on my business. Finding it much more fulfilling so far. Public Affairs 11 employee just Night Shift, lat√≠n america I create content on my social media profiles and Google ads No I didn't make the courses. Some digital products are pre-made like the course I sell, which gives others a better chance to make great income from something that is a done for you digital product. A fair income for all. This course gives Resell rights to others looking to learn, enhance their skills, and in return help others! The trash content makes me 6-figures a month.  Don't hate!! I work for a very large commerce company! I'm on a team of 7, but the sales part of our org has hundreds of people. As in - just hit home run by extreme luck. There are tons of people who are making mils by events of extreme luck. Some try their whole life. üòÄ But this is just my learning experience, and my shadows. Hey thanks for sharing, curious how did you acquire customers? Cold calling? 

No, we only charge 150 as labour to do the creative and setup their ads based on the targeting audience required for their business. Ad cost is fully responsible by them. Sure I have had employees in the past but I don‚Äôt anymore.   Everyone I have hired has stolen repair work, clients, or just not done a good job.  It‚Äôs a hard business to scale in that way because you have such little oversight of your employees.  Now I just work by myself.  I usually have anywhere from 90-100 accounts.  Around 200/month average plus 80$ quarterly for filter cleans.  So for service, I gross about 20k/month.  Then you have your expenses, chemicals, truck, insurance, tools etc.  Repairs and upgrades can be as anywhere from 3-20k additional each month.  Just depends on how many pools break down or what type of upgrades people are willing to do at the time.  I had a successful career as an aircraft mechanic before this.  I worked government contracts in areas of conflict like Africa, Afghanistan, etc.  made good money doing that but after my wife and I started having kids, I knew I didn‚Äôt want to be away for 6 months at a time working.  We live well within our means and I put the rest of the money in the stock market I live in Las Vegas.  So it‚Äôs not seasonal.  We work year round.  Some parts of the country they close the pools for winter.  It doesn‚Äôt get cold enough here for us to do that About $3M, but average deal is $500k-$1M. Standard 40 hrs, remote.¬† Standard 40 hrs/wk. I took this role bc they're premier service partners with all 3 of the hyperscalers, which makes it more of a co-selling motion with them rather than cold calling assigned accounts for net-new. We have after school/weekend  classes for kids.

Depends - if I see market movement that I like, I put in my orders.  If nothing peaks my interest then I don‚Äôt.  I usually have about 500k (stocks or cash) on order at any time.  I shoot for about 0.6-1% return every 3 weeks Div 05, and pre engineered building erection Hey man I appreciate it. I started in a commercial gym, trained a lot of clients, read a lot of books, took a lot of courses and went to a lot of seminars. Got into powerlifting and started training powerlifting clients. Learned the fundamentals of online business then grew from there yeah, can make 10k in a day if you have balls / luck Pretty much everything, as long as the talent for the position exists in our area, we can recruit for it. And the area has many great universities.

We currently do inbound sales, data analysts, customer support, we've had web devs in the past, we're starting to break into engineering, we do procurement, social media management, digital marketing, I'm touring the office next week for an outbound debt collection client, umm, chat support, content creation, SEO...ETC.

Literally anything, if it can be done over the phone or internet. And then we provide all the HR, payroll, IT, computers, desks, chairs, HMO for the staff, office parties and events.

It's super cool. I love it. üòé It has its ups and downs Scaling it back down to part time but due to Visa issue quitting is not gonna happen any time soon. Plus I like the job Sure, shot one your way Just curious if you don‚Äôt mind sharing, what type of industry do you work/have business in? What do you do? This right here. I waste my time on Reddit when I'm bored working. What I do is fairly mindless and pays well. [removed] How many people do you know that make 10k+ a month personally? Just curious. i do DFY lead gen for realtors- direct mail campaigns, cold calling, content creation, run ads, and DMs across big 4 LI, X, IG, FB. So far it‚Äôs been close to 6x. I gave him close to 30k when he was starting out and I manage his accounts as well Construction/design build Last year they brought in $4600 for the whole year. I invested about $20k to build my own platform in 2020 and then created a marketing course and a sales course with two different people, and now they promote the courses themselves and I get a passive income from them. Total the courses have returned $17k so I‚Äôm still out $3k on my investment but after this year I‚Äôll be positive indefinitely. I might invest more time/money into it because it‚Äôs actually a solid business model but it took a LOT of effort. 10k a month is over 100% annual dividends‚Ä¶. Either a lie, or invested in terrible stocks Just 1/2 and 1/3/(6/12)(when it runs) in the UK, so in ¬£ it‚Äôs less than 10k.

I usually play anywhere between 80 and 150 hours per month depending on how good the games are and what other things I have planned. I usually play between 5 and 7 days per week. I think my average hours per session was 4:19 last year. Amazon store we actually sell books. Agency is for saas growth solutions I spend 3hrs a day actual trading. I spend several hours reviewing, journaling, and talking strat with others. One was contract (40 hrs I billed) and the other was a regular full time that I was t super busy at. The contract ended and I never looked for a new one. I‚Äôm thinking about it now though. need to work about 15 days a month at my actual rate to do 10k. Production house are mostly those who gives me jobs Yes >How much are you earning?  

I charge around $4,000-$6,000 (some less, some more) per evaluation. So on average, if I want to gross $300k, I do 1-2 evaluations a week. If I want more money, I do more. 


>How many hours a week are you working

Anywhere from 0-60. I took about 8 weeks off completely in 2024. Sometimes I write remotely from vacation destinations. Some weeks are packed with travel or trial. 


>, and how are you getting your clients?  

Word of mouth and professional contacts. No advertising or marketing. 

>Any particular specialty?

Forensic I work a desk 7 of my shifts every 2 weeks so it's not physically demanding but it definitely isn't a good time working this many hours,  I'm 36 years old so I'm probably at the top of my hours worked bell curve I plan to keep this pace for approximately the next 6-7 years then dialing it back to just above full time. Hitting $10k a month isn‚Äôt about chasing one big idea‚Äîit‚Äôs about building multiple streams of income that play to your strengths. Start small, grow sustainably, and focus on what works while keeping your main income steady! 1. My job 
2. I make music which gets my anywhere from 200-500 a month 
3. Investing/money flipped in stocks 
4. Gambling income that's not from my main job.. doesn't always work of course cause you gambling but I've been lucky and flipped $6 into $1000 one night. And I put limits on my account so I can only deposit $300 a month 6 10s. Off sundays I buy return pallets from a local auction house. It‚Äôs lots of different things but I‚Äôve found a niche in health & beauty items so I mostly sell things like perfume, supplements, vitamins, make-up & hair products. Absolutely follow my business page on Facebook Gelea Green. I can send you over some information None of it was built from followers or engagements actually. 

I‚Äôve been in the industry 8 years but I pivoted online completely 2 years ago and I‚Äôm income doubled! I have them pay up front. Ok Yes I did DM me I do have a cool portfolio https://mikeardent.my.canva.site/portfolio Quite a few areas of advice to what I do, but to name a few - pension drawdown advice which requires annual reports and full cashflow projections, EIS/VCT investments, pension SIPP investments (mainly commercial property purchases via a pension). Within the investments themselves, it‚Äôs generally a very wide range of managed funds from quite a few different providers. The funds themselves are generally medium/medium-high risk, returning between 7%-9%pa over a 10 year period. I was tired I misread but sell something and make calls is my answer üòÇüòÇüòÇ Weird. That's also in my how to lose 10k a month guide. Thanks so much for this- really valuable insights What is the actual process of selling? How do you find people who are interested? Were all of your businesses started or did you acquire any of them? Doubt he's lying, what would be the point. However, like his attitude towards being a landlord, his post offers zero value. The people like you who call ‚Äúbullshit‚Äù on every single post are so tiring.  Like, do you operate from a place of lying in your day to day life?  Is dishonesty your go-to, so you‚Äôre primed to expect that of others?   Why is that your knee jerk reaction to things?   Not just you, but all that are like you. Of course he is. This sub attracts the best of dreamers who lie to themselves What is he saying that even seems remotely farfetched? This is a post asking about making over 10k a month. Pretty low bar these days This is the strategy used by McDonalds, their business model is actually based on the lease of the building to the franchise they sell to. So regardless of fluctuations in the food industry the real estate focus provides them with stability. Hah, spot on. Hilarious to read some of the things that get posted on here. Anyhow LL would just be billing it back through CAM to the extent it did most of the stuff that poster was taking about (except maybe structure or amortized capex if the tenant had a good negotiating position). Where is the bar located? I own one currently , looking to add a second. If your looking for things to possibly add Ive created multiple different automations for newsletters that Im looking to start getting out there.

Shoot me a message That 1st point is really interesting & would be super valuable. I'd be curious to learn about the tool once it launches. Are you a developer yourself? [removed] Nice! How is that monetised? Sure I‚Äôll pm How much do you make out of it? Oh awesome! URL?

Mine is a user onboarding agency for B2B SaaS (self-serve/ PLG onboarding). Ohh really?  
is it alright if i ask you which country you live in?  
what about work from home which countries law will work on you the employers right? Something I‚Äôve always been curious about, I had no idea about the ebook market other than YouTube vids explaining it as a funnel Very interesting. I am curious how much you can charge in a hyper specific niche and average pages per book Can you give an example please How long did it take you to see a ROI? [deleted] You're the best. You've been answering every single question! Interesting! Thanks for answering. Wishing you and your business continued success. üôÇ I understand this,but recently came across the realisation that not everyone know how to use AI, they may have heard of it in the news but have never actually tried using it. Sure, with time more and more  people may come to use it, but... The main seller is usually convenience.. If you show a costumer that they've just come across an ebook that will show them a very in depth knowledge about something (rather than needing to watch multiple videos to hopefully fill in all knowledge gals) there will be a bigger pull to that. Now just set the price to its value and how much pain it would save a costumer. I‚Äôm an architectural consultant - in one of my niches I sell instructional guides on how to navigate UK planning laws and building regulations to builders/developers/homeowners. I also sell how to draw your own UK compliant plans and compile them. 

It‚Äôs very specific to a Uk audience and AI simply doesn‚Äôt have the depth of knowledge. 

On the back of that I upsell consultation services/full drawing services etc. 

It will never make me millions, but with ads and a couple of hours a week checking on things, it‚Äôs pretty passive. Da-Uh ... Space out?! And realistically unless you‚Äôre an employee of a firm you almost *have* to have experience with success stories to tell of previous clients you successfully shepherded through whatever process is at play, because there‚Äôs tons of money and risk involved for the client so nobody is willing to hire a niche consultant who isn‚Äôt already experienced in the niche thing they‚Äôre trying to accomplish. 

It just adds too much risk if you have to also factor in ‚ÄúThe guy telling me what to do to have this all go right in my favor is possibly as new to this as I am and we all might be full of shit.‚Äù on top of all of the starting risks. lol Just curious, for consulting startups for GTM strategy, what would be a typical monthly charge ? I did this years ago before I re-entered the corporate space. I think I need to start understanding the changes to seeking clients outside of simply networking. Referrals have always been my major funnel but acquiring clients for whom I do not have a connection will be key as well. I have a health insurance backup so fortunately that does not play a role. Thank you for encouraging further thought on branching out again. Nice. This strikes me as a consulting job where you provide these services after achieving x amount of years experience. Thanks for the response. Do you have any use for a remote intern? I am an MBA grad with a six sigma belt and would love to gain experience in this industry Thanks üëç My 9 year old kid likes to make games on scratch and (off course) on Roblox. Would kindly advise what he should learn next if he would like to be a game designer? Thenewboston, that u? :o You hiring? Wow. Could AI take your job ? Lifegoals right there That‚Äôs amazing! congratulations! I'm an restoration / historical reconstruction architect who got into Blender, and then Unreal, a few years ago - I don't suppose your studio is working on any games that need low-poly hyper-detailed historically-accurate environments? I'm also open to being called an ""intern"" and doing gruntwork jobs if it means learning the basics and putting my toe in some educational water. Either way - keep it up, sounds like you're doing awesome Btw you can also generally learn this stuff for free on YouTube. But I tend to prefer something like Udemy as it provides a more clear structure, with practice assignments and stuff. Also having a little skin in the game (even if it‚Äôs just $10) makes me more motivated to actually finish the course. A bit of both. I personally go to marketing conferences and try to network with marketers/business owners. Sometimes I land a client and sometimes I don‚Äôt. Being out there has really contributed of me getting leads Yeah advertising. People who try to get people to make their ads no worries - glad to help!

So I think you should work backwards. Find out what niches you can make money out of and then choose from there.

B2B, finance, sport, business, very passionate niches like watches. Any of these have a lot of money Yeah it's a reply to someone that's out of context, too. spammy LOL thought I was the only one Can u recommend sources where to learn these skills I just finished cs50 course from Harvard and know I understand concept of computer science . What to do next? Appreciate the answer Have you played [Midori no Kaori](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2903160/Midori_no_Kaori/)? Feels similar to Furnish Master except different vibe. Marble Clash: Fun Shooter? It has over 10M downloads, and just makes 2k? 

Don't get me wrong, congrats to you because that's amazing, but I thought games/apps with 10M+ millions downloads made more than 50k+ monthly through ad revenue and in-app purchases [removed] So enough people buy the Furnish Master game each month to earn you $10k+ per month consistently from one-time purchases each month? That's impressive man, I did not know the indie games space was large enough for that. It's a cool idea too. Congrats! What games have yourself played that impacted you the most? Interesting, Twitter usually does not do well directly for casual games. Your niche must have a hit home on Twitter. Good for you. 

Yes, Meta has been terrible it takes more dialing in now compared to before. That's why I have shifted to other native platforms and pyramid publishers, then I use Meta only for retargeting. 

Thanks for the insights üçª Oh nice i've seen furnish master before üôèüëç [removed] THANK YOU :) how you came to idea of ""Furnish Master"" ? Im not into furnishing, are there a lot of people that love that? Just DL Marble Clash, great lil game Me too ‚Ä¶ The company is called Arse Tickler‚Äôs Faggots Fan Club. Pick up the phone and start dialing. Thanks so much, I'll check out that site with the paths you laid out in mind. Appreciated! and you do all of this with just two in the team?! you must have outgrown initial setup, no? anyway, congrats. As you said you do hard part, which looks like paying off nicely! Would love some more info on your services, trying to plan a trip to Asia! if you need any help here in brasil let me know we can probably make some money together Thank you for the response, I know this specific post says $10,000/mo, but would you share what your actual say annual income is?  I have been researching this industry for quite some time and am very close to moving in this direction, I just have to be able to support my family. Is that your gross or what you take home after expenses? Your shop sounds great. I have no problem paying a premium for that kind of service/environment - the feeling you get is ""We never recommend parts or repairs that aren't necessary because we do very well without resorting to that and we never want to mess with our reputation.""  Best thing for you to do is expand, but on your own. New construction. All that. Bigger buildings mean nothing, more coverage does Have you considered multiple locations, or franchising? I'm on a similar path. Id like to partner w a mechanic.

I build the building, lease you your shop you do your thing, in return I get access to the facility in my own bay. Ever think about adding a detailing partner when you expand? How is scaling the mobile mechanic a huge investment? Was it mainly the vehicles/tools on them? What makes do you focus on? I‚Äôve owned a franchise automotive repair location but they want things done their way and take 50% of profit. It wasn‚Äôt a bad living at all but I prefer to run things my way. I sold the location a few years ago and I‚Äôm looking to get back into the industry. My hesitation is starting with nothing and with no clients yet. I‚Äôm also wanting a prime location to maximize potential but those locations are hard to come by. 

I know your circumstance is different than mine but I‚Äôm curious how long it took you to scale to where you are now? Nice. Working on everything or specialist? [removed] How many bays? You'd need to have more than a handful of bays (at least 4 at full capacity) and be *very* busy to be doing that much volume at standard hourly rates.

This would be an unusual case for a mom and pop repair shop. Most of the shops I've seen for sale are doing closer to $150-300k in margin per year, and I've been looking to buy one for awhile now - haven't seen anything close to your numbers. Wow that's unreal Great work mate, how many days a week you open, what are your hours, and do you also have a shop manager so you can focus on the business, not just the day to day/ also can you take time off/vacation? [removed] He said 5X that. Thats $50k/month. Or $600k/yr. That would be hard as straight profit (ie after operating costs and employee salaries and all that) Math is tough Per month? Very Is that 15K in net profits? Not bad! What is meant by event party scripts?? What platform do you use to sell them Curious to know how you sell these? Etsy? Social media ads? [deleted] Which payment method? I missed this can I still join? lol definitely not Can you share the link? Can‚Äôt find it on your bio. Thanks in advance No link, please share - this seems legit and that is why we would love to see what you do and hear more about what your process looks like :) Do share your TikTok and YouTube channel pls ‚ô•Ô∏è What type of products do you sell? how generalised is the content? Like, are you teaching people how to sew, or are you giving detailed instructions on how to create a unique book binding (nerdforge sorta stuff)? You sell on Etsy or another platform Do you sell the crafts itself or literally just digital? Neat. I had a similar path where my background was in web dev and I ended up getting a job in identity and access management, and have done that since 08.

I've specialised in Microsoft Identity Manager though, which is very much on its way out. Where are you.from? Neither is $10k a month in distributions from a business, but that's kind of moving the goal posts. I was assuming OP meant gross take-home, not net. Can you share some resources as how to find a business and get funding. In what world is *buying a business* easier than getting a job? You need credit, experience, and capital to do so. Where are you getting that from? You‚Äôve just described any decent sales role. Sales dawg I would say the level of stress when you‚Äôre not self employed varies greatly based on responsibilities, who you‚Äôre working for, industry, etc. Id say the opposite in my experience. A bad manager can destroy ones life and mental health and not easy to find a new job in today's economy. There's no security at least in the US where you can be fired for no reason with no ability to collect unemployment etc. and you also just lost your health benefits on the same day.¬† I like to say ""there's a thin line between being self-employed and unemployed"" Yes because when you‚Äôre employed and get fired your income only goes to zero. If something goes wrong with your business you could potentially lose everything you‚Äôve invested and more, you are also responsible for your employees incomes. I work on commission only, there‚Äôs been months where I‚Äôve made ¬£0. In the UK real estate works a bit different, sales can fall through on day of exchange simply because the buyer changed their mind. Had to work night shifts for a while, was doing 80 hour weeks. Not good for your mental health, but persevered. I'm a Sales Engineer. I work with an account executive. He handles the people side of the sale, I handle the technical side of the sale. I do Demo's and dig and find out about customers needs for the product I'm selling. I sell a platform that customers really need, so it's not that difficult to find prospects. Closing the sale is the hard part :). If you know an IT product, see if they have Sales Engineer position open. I'm a Sales Engineer.

Ideally b2b Lmao nice backhanded compliment Ohhh we call it ‚Äúevent rental company‚Äù in our area. Cool, yeah my wife and I thought of doing this as we have a lot of money on hand to start a business like this. Any suggestions or tips? Send a DM if you want. My idea is to work for a company that does it locally and learn how they operate and mimic it with my own flavor added. Is the 40-60k per month net profits or gross profits? [removed] Getting started is the hardest part. How long did it take to get 5k? Is 45k per month your average? Whars your average before this month? I‚Äôm looking  to get into this industry Shut up and take my money! Wtf does taking the piss mean?!?? You have to spend money to make money, I guess Thankyou very much for the advice.

Thankfully its not a super backend reliant product, so ive done some calculating with regards to using firestore and the free tier and with my best calculations I should be able to get a solid number of clients before it starts eating away at profits which is currently my only saving grace.. Aside from my time and some minor marketing costs im hoping I can slowly build a clientbase that snowballs to the point that, when it does start costing me, the profits will be enough to cover it.  
Ive got quite a few ideas to expand the service, but my hope is getting an mvp out with a much lower cost compared to the ¬£60/month someone was paying for a similar service will allow me to get my foot in the door and grow.

I really hope I can come back to this post one day and tell you of my success. Even ¬£3k a month would be amazing! üòî Congrats, out of curiosity what skillset does it take to create a project like this? Like when someone creates a coin on a chain, are you writing any code to build it out? I've seen a lot of these launch on Sol and on Hype recently and I always wonder how devs actually start creating these projects. How‚Äôd you get started with the home warranty companies if you don‚Äôt mind me asking. My background is the same as yours and I‚Äôve repaired appliances before. Just updated the firmware on someone‚Äôs washing machine when another guy said it needed a motor. Honestly I just googled it and that was the first thing that popped up. Anyway I digress. I‚Äôm sure you dropped them because they were a pain to work with but obviously a good place to start. Cheers legend, as someone who is over office life in their early 30s, something like this is very appealing (been considering a trade for a bit now).. How is it in the body? How do you feel about samsung fridges? Thanks for the detailed reply Grr [removed] Can you share your Etsy store via dm? [deleted] I don‚Äôt want to say exactly because of NDAs but yes enough to retire. I sold for 12x earnings. I signed a 4 year non compete and agreed to stay on as GM until I‚Äôm ready to move on. I rolled equity in and will cash out that equity when the private equity group flips the portfolio again. Earnings another 3-5x on the money I reinvested. I‚Äôm 38 so I‚Äôll probably do this all over again one more time before really retiring. Once you learn the system/method you can build a home service business and sell it quite quickly. Private equity won‚Äôt really look at you unless you‚Äôre at $10m in revenue. That‚Äôs the key. Build to $10m, make $2m in profit, sell for 12x that $2m and put $24m (pre taxes) in the bank. Or hold onto it longer and keep growing. Who manufactures your products? You yourself or someone else? Pay thanks , I‚Äôll do some research and see how I can learn about IE or IR Yes [removed] Mind sharing any case studies? [removed] Hey Eli, can I DM you? What skills did you focus on? How did you approach your first client? This is interesting. I work in something similar. Is it a billable hour type of business? Do I need to have a background in software/tech? Can you help me [removed] [removed] I am hating, you are one of the reasons social media is complete trash Run ads for the service I sell. I made the service I sell into a product which can help any businesses from anywhere around the world. 

Client see our ads on social media, contacts us and makes the payment on the spot if they really require the services which I offer. [removed] [deleted] What kind of classes are netting $100k? That's wild! Good for you! I would assume you must have a lot of kids enrolled with those numbers. I can't imagine paying thousands as a parent of 1 for after school services. How do you run it specifically? Do you have a certain community or a website? Do you outsource the jobs out of the us or within the us? What‚Äôs your method to attract clients, over the phone/email/ in person? I'm doing copywriting I took multiple courses, but I did not land my first client any help please i have portfolio could you help me with some advice please Construction

Vertical and Underground two different companies. Our primary focus is building schools. Combined we average 30 million per year.

The example in the above comment was a personal revenue example. Oil and Gas. I got into a position in which I owned some leasehold that a major company (incorrectly) thought they'd leased. But they didn't lease the right people; I did. Had to spend four years fighting them in court. I have been doing something similar. Engineer day job and construction/Eng recruiting side hustle. Mind if I dm you? [removed] Where do you get the books from? How are you able to get work that generates that much if you don't mind me asking? [removed] Oh Ok Cool Thankyou for sharing! Interesting mind if I pm you? I listed the businesses on bizbuysell I have done a mix of buying and starting from zero.  I bought a restaurant and started the bar from zero.  I bought an aesthetic beauty business, but started another from zero in another state.  The online training I started from zero.  So it a mix and match situation here. The incentive to lie on an anonymous forum is high. 

They are right to question any and everything posted here. You must be one of the ones who lie if this struck a nerve. Either that or you‚Äôre unbearably na√Øve Yes! well not the best dev out there so I am using Cursor haha.

So yea I am building this for me essentially as I have this issue but thinking if it works well to productize it Honestly, if you can't infer it from what I wrote then probably not much I can tell you that you'll understand. The video is a good watch. Be curious. Mostly sponsors either through Beehiiv ad network or Passionfroot Very lucrative if you‚Äôve spent the time to build an audience who are hungry for the knowledge/experience/instruction you can give 250-350ish pages and depending on the topic $20-60 per title Pick a niche. Now pick a niche within that niche. Now pick a niche within *that* niche that you happen to be knowledgeable in. Monetise that. Didn‚Äôt start making money with books for about 18 months - got some advice and retargeted My ROI is pretty good - I‚Äôve found Amazon ads have been more expensive for me. Google ads pretty much useless. Always happy to answer questions! That would depend on your experience (if you're the one pitching GTM consulting), the scope of work, the value you create/can demonstrate, and your ability to sell. I would think that businesses with this need would pay at least $2-3k/month on the low end. 

If you're generating value and make it easy for your clients to work with you and get results quickly without making them chase you, I'd think you could charge closer to 5 figures per month. 

But as I said, this all depends on you. Best of luck! If you were successful in the past, I believe you can be successful today. There have never been so many ways to find clients. Not at the moment but I may if I sign up another customer or two (in talks with one as we speak). DM me to set up a call to meet and explore what that would look like. Does it take learning how to program or is game design completely different? Game dev is fucking hard and don‚Äôt let anyone tell you otherwise.

It‚Äôs easy to start and make something very basic, but don‚Äôt plan on being able to sell anything for years (if ever).

You need to understand what makes a game fun and then create that on the screen. Go look at new releases on steam and you‚Äôll see what I‚Äôm talking about.

Hundreds of games released daily that might even look/ play great, but never sell a single copy for one reason or another.

Point is, don‚Äôt start this thinking it will make you money any time soon (if ever). > But I tend to prefer something like Udemy as it provides a more clear structure

If someone out there reading this is just absolutely broke but still wants to try, then use udemy + youtube. When looking at a udemy course, it generally has some sort of outline or syllabus. You can usually use this outline as a guide for what to search for on YouTube to get started. Youtube has everything these days. Just learn and practice :) Also meet people from the industry and chat with them, you will learn a lot. The game makes more than that. I only get 2k because we have a publisher and a team behind this game. Plus I have a partner, so we share profits. We also spend over 80% on ads. Game's monthly gross is around 60-70k.

But you are correct, the came could perform better. It does not have very nice numbers because of poor monetization and retention. Two years in my free time, mostly on weekends. Yes, I was a solo developer, but I occasionally outsourced some tasks. Correct. Actually, more than $20k a month after taxes. I have a detailed graph of the game's sales and wishlists in the link below (not sure this sub allows links though). Since I do not have an investor or a publisher, I choose not to hide this data and share it with other indie devs as something to learn from.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19HqhPcP656X2LecI7u90Ux3ssYwb\_eHvIm7suUf5EbQ/](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19HqhPcP656X2LecI7u90Ux3ssYwb_eHvIm7suUf5EbQ/) I do not know how to answer that question. I just come up with ideas that seem marketable and then search for references. Sometimes other games impact my ideas, but that depends on the game. For PC it's the social media. Simply compare post interactions (upvotes, shares etc) and feedback. Also you can run paid ads.

For mobile game you can run ads and see how cheap it will be to bring new people. Then you make a playable version to test basic numbers such as retention, playtime, and ROI e.t.c. Well, it was a ‚Äúclean the room‚Äù concept, but later I decided to make it a sandbox game where people could furnish rooms however they liked. Overall, I have many unfinished prototypes. This was just one of many that got good feedback from Reddit users the first time I posted about it, so I decided to continue. Thank you :) That only works in the US where privacy and non intrusiveness are ignored by people . Try that shit in Europe, you're in for a surprise.. Could email marketing work better? Two primary travel agents, plus one that only sells Disney part time, and two part time assistants that do data entry and some client customer service. I do everything on the backend while my wife heads up sales. And yes, it's paying off nicely. Covid hit us hard, causing us to rely on charity for our personal needs, but we came out the other side much stronger. I appreciate that, however I don't pursue leads on Reddit through my personal account. It's the one place I can discuss politics and as a small business in a very blue state and conservative leaning politics, it could be devastating for my business and my employees to have my politics mix with business. I'm just not willing to go there.

What I can tell you, is that you can find a great agent through Google Maps. Search for a ""travel agent"" in a major Metropolitan area and you are sure to find the best of the best as you look at reviews. In rural areas, word of mouth reputation is your best bet. Ask them if they have experience with the mode of travel and countries you are looking for and if they have resources in the destination. Some travel agents charge a fee over and above the commission they collect that's built into hotels, tours, and the like, so ask about that upfront. There are many great agents that charge a fee and some that don't, but it can be a good value for some depending on the services offered for that fee. Sorry I can't help you directly, but I can't risk putting the livelihood of my people at risk with my quite tame politics that happen to not be tolerated by many. I appreciate that but we only exclusively work through trusted and establoshed tour operators and destination management companies that have operations in the US and have the ability to process transactions in the US so our clients don't get hit with foreign transaction fee or a company that doesn't perform and we have no legal recourse in the US.

If you work in travel in Brazil and want to grow your business here in the US, I'd be happy to share the expectations that most agencies have to become more palitable. Feel free to share about your business and I'd be happy to give some advice. I've seen others prosper based on similar advice. It can be a hard one to get started with. Our net income in our first year was about $2000. The second was $15,000. This year it was about $220,000. This next year I'm estimating $275,000 net. We've been in business about 10 years with Covid in the middle, which was absolutely devastating and I was shopping at food banks. 

It takes time to get proficient, find customers, and your income is mostly commissions that are received after travel, which means lead times on payment can take months or even years. I have one $300,000 luxury world cruise in a top suite that was booked in 2023 and doesn't travel until 2026. That's a lot of time for something to go wrong.

The payoff with the travel and funds can be great, but it's a tough nut to crack. Most agents have another job when they are getting started or a spouse with a separate income.

I've discovered that the easiest way to crack that nut is to buy into a ftanchise. This isn't the route I took, but franchise owners get big wins sooner and with less risk. The downside is that you will forever be giving them a higher cut of the take so you could limit your growth, but we've been far more successful than most other companies in this space. Most fizzle and die, or never make more than a small side income, so make the smart choice and go with the franchise to nearly guarantee great results. Gross. It‚Äôs gross 99.9% of the time. No, best thing is to talk to the landlord and extend the lease 5+ more years. Or, buy the building. Then, work the business hard and make as much EBIDA as possible over the next two years. Then, sell the business, possibly with the building included. 

Get paid to stay a while, get your personal life back in order, wait until noncompete is up, then do it again. Just faster and easier this time. I don't see this working unless you get a unicorn. Most mechanics make awful business people. 

You would be better building the entire shop and hiring qualified guys to do the work and have someone running the front end. Nah, margins in detailing suck. That's a volume play that I don't have any interest in. 

Saying that, if I got into sales I would most likely hire a detailer for that side of the business and offer it to retail customers because why not. 

But as far as having a hard focus on detailing there's not enough profit in it for me. The vehicles for one. Insurance. Where I live I would need a seperate business license for each van. Every mechanic would need to be licensed. Couldn't have an apprentices. Then that van would be able to max it's revenunat only $15-20k a month. Just not worth the hassle. All makes and models. I had my mobile business for 3 years that was just me in a van. I got into the shop in 2022 and I was at the point of hiring about a year in. So all in all it's taken me 6 years to get to this point. If I did it again, I would've skipped the mobile nonsense because the shop has been a lot easier to scale. 

I paid extra for a prime location. I could've gotten more space, for less money, in an industrial park but I feel auto service is almost a retail play. I have no regrets paying the extra. 

I started super lean with the shop as well. I did everything for the first 18 months. The repairs, accounting, invoicing, phones, appointments, everything. I've been in the trade for 15 years as well so I already had all the tooling I needed. Only had to buy the lifts, tire equipment, compressor. The big stuff. All makes and models. We also try to keep the work to wear and tear as well as maintenance. 

Not a lot of heavy line work. If we do sell big work I try to price it out the door so if we get a go ahead on it we don't lose out. Gross profit is about 75%, net 50%. You would be amazed at how much a well-run auto repair shop can make. I work with several
owners across the US who do well over $4M/yr in sales out of 8-10 bay shops. Industry benchmark is 20% net profit, and most of my network is hitting that consistently. Dude said in another comment essentially that he's trying to be the ""Apple"" of mechanics.

You're paying for the fluff, not the substance.  He may do amazing work too (as Apple does), but he's also probably jacking up the price bc he gives that ""premium"" vibe to his clients.

I've got a sibling that's a baker, and they do this same thing.  Easily charging 2x-3x what I'd ever consider paying for a loaf of bread or cookie, or fancy pastry....and they sell out every week.

If you can convince gullible people you're something special, they'll gladly hand over their money to you, even if they can get the same thing at a fraction of the price elsewhere. $90k Salary. I took about $100k in distributions as well. Not that hard with a profitable shop really. If I had 3 more bays I could double it. Average mechanic salary is 60k, you think the owner of a mechanic shop is not making what 2 mechanics make in profit? I mean maybe if it's really struggling or he's just starting sure but 120k a year is well within reason Structured social media posts. Explains why so many look alike.¬† Combination. We have a woocommerce store for a more traditional add to cart style shopping experience. But I also use clickfunnels for all of our sales funnels from landing pages, sales flows, to our courses. 

And then we use Kajabi to host our membership, but I really don‚Äôt like their checkout pages or funnels. We have a Facebook group that‚Äôs we‚Äôve grown to a little over 11,000 members, mostly through collaboration and word of mouth. 

We also have grown our email list to a little over 9,000 pretty engaged followers.

It really doesn‚Äôt take as much as people think to make a significant income. nice try diddy [deleted] Stripe, PayPal, Klarna, Apple Pay I‚Äôd be interested in seeing your Etsy page too! It is legit but I don‚Äôt like posting personal info on Reddit It‚Äôs crochet/knitting. I give detailed instructions on how to complete an item from start to finish Etsy and my  personal site I do both but I recently started leaning more into the digital items because it takes less time and I can make more money faster Ghana üá¨üá≠ Where I first learned about it was Codie Sanchez on YouTube.¬† I never said it was easier. I said it is a third option to 1. Getting a job, and 2. Building a business. It‚Äôs easy to get a job, but if you want to make real money and build true wealth, you need to have ownership. And it‚Äôs way easier to buy a business than it is to build a business.¬† Sure but the guarantee of a paycheck is worth a lot of stress relief. Yeah but the nice thing about being employed by a third party is that you can quit anytime you want too. Self employment usually has a ball and chain element that isn‚Äôt simple to just stop. If you‚Äôre a solid worker you always have options to go elsewhere. Yeah, and the funny thing is that a lot of people who are self employed are so because they are somewhat unemployable because the kind of
Person who likes to go off on their own generally don‚Äôt like doing things other people‚Äôs way Technical products for industry It took me around 5‚Äì6 weeks to reach 5K followers. I combined my posts with daily livestreams for a couple of hours and it helped a lot. December has been exceptional because of the holidays. I usually average between $15K-$20K the coin doesn't exist Basically they create a Telegram group for it, create the coin on pumpfun, pay for dex and then start raiding mad on X. Most of the creators have Kol groups so they just send the token info there inorder to pump it more. In the end, ppl get used as Exit Liquidity. Leading to a Rugged project. 

Pretty Savage game but it works like that. No skills whatsoever. Just go to their websites and fill out the form. I would recommend going slow to start off as they won't train you how to work with them. Do one or two calls a week for a month or two so you can make sure you're doing everything right to get paid. I do residential appliance repair, and it is not hard on the body at all. I do wear kneepads under my pants every day, and gloves and a respirator when needed. There are not a lot of hazards to this job which is why I went to it. I'm amazed that people still buy them. They have been mostly terrible for quite some time, and I would never purchase one. Just survived long enough. More time in business allows more people to find you. 

I have over 200k in revenue before I posted anything on social media. 

Did over 700k before we got a sign on our building. 

Not saying you should follow my lead. But it's how I did it. 

Kept expenses low and was ok with scraping by while enjoyed freedom. 

I was 25. I'm 32 now. Married with a son. I do work more on building it now. No ads. We make $$ if landscapers use card (stripe) to charge their clients inside the app. $1 per transaction. If not using cards, all is free. Designed in house and manufactured by one of our suppliers Product management, project management, cyber security, engineering roles, roles in mining‚Ä¶. All have the potential for that sort of coin. Senior HR roles in mining business, heaps of options really. Net profit was in the 19% range last year. The second one is a loaded question. We do everything from your basic service work to some light commercial. Some jobs are easy and some are a huge pain in the ass. Obviously we do a lot of your generic stuff, like toilet rebuilds, clogged drains, faucet installs and stuff like that. We also do rough ins for custom homes, some smaller commercial projects, water line and sewer line replacements, etc. our average ticket was just over $800 last year. I mean that affiliate codes are one of the worst ways of monetizing an audience. Yes we create or white label products instead. Sure It is What do you do? Same question, my only sales experience is in real estate (and cell phones) luck. 

was in a job that i hated so i was motivated to apply to 50 jobs a day and interviewed with anyone who‚Äôd take me. 

after about a year of applying i landed my first tech role
at a small euro owned tech company as one of their first US employees. 

That company ballooned into a Unicorn within a year of arrival.

at that point - the talent was head hunted out (myself included) and the journey continues.

Apply to everything bc you only need just one. Teaching people how to do the same :) www.schoolofsimulation.com Whatever For years I worked a lot.  Back then I had about 120 accounts.  So service the accounts money-Friday and then repairs Saturday and Sunday.  It wasn‚Äôt uncommon for me to work 12 hours everyday during the week and the 10-12 on the weekends also.  But I don‚Äôt work that hard anymore.  Most of my pools are pretty easy stops.  Learning how to evaluate the back yard is important.  Look at where the trees are and what the usually prevailing wind direction is.  If the pool is down wind from the trees or landscaping, either bid the account higher in price to account for that, or if it‚Äôs bad, don‚Äôt take it on at all.  I average 2.3 pools an hour. It happened quick.  After I stopped deploying, I took an office job and I hated it.  I had looked into pool service as a business about 10 years before.  So I went to national pool route sales and bought an already established pool route.  Bought 68 pools so I had cash flow right away.   I wouldn‚Äôt do it that way today but that‚Äôs what i did years ago.  If I were starting out today, I would just go get a job at a company and learn that way and then start taking on my own clients.  I would recommend getting your CPO certification also ( Certified Pool Operator).  You will learn a lot from that especially proper chemistry.   We did some advertising at the beginning.  I would look on google earth and find houses with pools and then we would send mailers out.  I haven‚Äôt done that in years though.  Once you have an established business and a good customer base, word of mouth is all you need to get new clients.  I turn down most new potential clients or give them to friends I have made in the industry that need more clients.   Yes we sell things like cleaners also and make money on those.   I have bought an entire container full of the electronic automatic cleaners and made money on them.  That was a large investment 200k for the container and then I had to sell them.  I wouldn‚Äôt do that again.  It was profitable but it‚Äôs stressful to have money tied up in that much inventory. Yes we have about 800 weekly students now plus summer camps.  Last year we did about 20+% growth in top line YOY without much added expenses so definitely good.  Hopefully we can add another 15-20% again this year. Very cool thanks for that. Additionally, you said it takes years to get to that point, what would you say contributed most to the success of the company? (From what you contributed) Not at all. 
Also in/thomasalascio Mistakes were made. Lmao 

To be honest, the reason is because the course my business partner and I developed were custom made in Adobe Captivate. We wanted to allow students to write essays, make sketches in the platform, and do all sorts of little custom gamification-type activities. These required custom javascript to create, as well as a backend server to save our student's uploaded answers and content. There is definitely simpler ways we could've done this and we went all-in on an ""ideal end product"" instead of cranking out minimum viable products. I was pretty new to entreprenurialship when I started and have learned a ton since then. Though the two courses we made still generate revenue with zero work, I have other business activities I'm involved in that will be much more lucrative, fun, and my approach is much more efficient. We have software that finds books we can flip. We buy in used conditions and restore them to sell in better condition. We‚Äôre opening a second store next month 3,000+ books Are you a licensed plumber? I had been licensed about 5 years when I started  my private practice. Profit was immediate. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any incentive to lie or to tell the truth. It‚Äôs anonymous so what do you get out of it either way? If you‚Äôre lying maybe you think it‚Äôs funny, if you‚Äôre telling the truth it either makes you feel good about yourself because you‚Äôre doing well or you do it because you want to help people. None of these things are a real incentive. I'm a bit of a nit, and I'd slam the report spam button so fast on that email, but that would be an undeniably useful tool. I'd even use it. What stage are you at with it? [removed] I am curious how you went building your audience. Not sure all of us have niche knowledge at that level my guy What was the advice? Any of it AI assisted? Were FB ads useful? I sold 5 copies of my ebooks through organic marketing on my social media but I've been contemplating whether I should try ads to sell more It‚Äôll take time learning anything that makes good money. People aren‚Äôt handing over extra cash cause they just want to, but because they are paying for a service that took someone a while to learn. Game design is a lot more than just programming you need to really know the market and the strategies other game devs use. You'll likely also need to create art or work with an artist. Developing a game was much harder for me than my regular software engineering career Sort of yes, sort of no. UE5 and other 3d arts are based in C++ and python but they use node systems instead of hand coding. So it's more like plugging together a circuit board. You still have to understand basic code logic, but it's bit more intuitive than traditional programming. Makes sense. Still a great accomplishment. 

For the Steam game do you have a team too, or is it only you? According to what you say, I understand it gets a little over 1000 sales per month, right? wow, thank you for offering this level of insight! Nice share - this is super interesting to see!

You worked hard too it seems - over 1.5 years on it before you saw any revenue?

It's interesting how much of the coverage you dug up early on was Asian even though it's only something like 14% of sold volume. Is there a reason behind that initial hype for you or is it normal? How much do you think this still influenced the final popularity? Curious your take on how effective you consider your twitter ad spend was? Seems to have some spikes in wishlists but doesn't seem to convert immediately into sales. Does that align with your expectations? Would you do paid ads on other platforms? Well done, really.

I think that is a game that I suspect might provide a pretty high amount of 'play' vs the amount time that you need to invest in development. So I think there maybe you had an eye for spotting a good realizable idea.

Also the execution seems great with both lighting and UX. Cool, thanks Sorry. 

Move to America. 

Pick up the phone and start dialing. Other than visiting businesses in person, which is highly inefficient at scale, calling businesses is probably the best way to get immediate feedback, build your list of objections, build confidence in you and your product, and understand why people might be buying or not buying. 

I almost 100% of the time use cold calling to figure out all the kinks in the product pre-launch. 

It‚Äôs one thing to do market research and all that other shit, but when it comes to actually hitting the ground running, there is still at the very minimum a visible chunk of unknowns that you‚Äôre going to have that are only going to be answered by getting the product / service in front of your suspected target audience. Yeah i doubt a garage makes 550k a year in profit‚Ä¶. Unless its something super niche Gross Margin? Or Revenue.¬† Why not do this with two buildings? Thanks for the input, my friend. Keep killing it! Value is in the eye of the beholder. In marketing and human psychology there's virtually no difference between placebo and the ""real"" thing in most cases. 

I wish people were less condescending to entrepreneurs who have figured out how to improve the experience and generate larger margins. Everyone's success should be celebrated and learned from. I knew this was viable. People won‚Äôt want to go to ugly shady looking shops especially as they hold onto their cars longer and want to take care of them better. I might be looking at shops again.¬† People want it more when the price is higher and they can rationalize it. It's not convincing people your something special.  It's giving them great customer service and making them feel good about giving their hard earned money to you.  Example:  Chic Fil A, never had a bad experience and employees are always a pleasure to deal with.  Lines are always busy, but you still get through drive thru faster than a McDonalds or Burger with 1 or no cars in the line.  There's a reason Chic Fil As are always busy.  People like the positive experience and will keep coming back.  And it's a reason Chic Fil A can afford to be closed 52 days a year and still make more than McDonald's, BK, etc. Do you not know what 5x means? As a Service Manager if you have a busy shop it's possible. By busy I mean you got commercial fleets not so much as B2C(Random customers, Scheduled Oil changes) Wow I love this thank you for your response. Your success is inspiring. Selling digital products successfully depends on finding the right audience. I've tried using Gumroad for easy distribution and building my reach via Reddit, which was quite effective. A tool like Pulse for Reddit also helps with engaging directly in relevant discussions and building community trust. Check out if targeting niche communities works for you too! Rule 2: Never say never All these? I Will send a pr√≠vate message I Will send a pr√≠vate message I have heard it about through her and the my first million podcast, but have never had the opportunity to talk to someone who has done it. You've hit the nail on the head! Look, here's the deal - buying a business is like getting a head start in the wealth-building race. Think of it this way: when you get a job, you're trading time for money. When you build a business from scratch, you're taking a huge gamble with both time AND money (and let me tell you, about 80% of startups don't make it past year five).

But buying an existing business? Now that's playing it smart. You're stepping into something that's already making money, has customers, and most importantly - has PROVEN it works. It's like buying a house that's already built versus trying to construct one from the ground up. Sure, it might cost more upfront, but:

1. You're getting cash flow from day one
2. You've got existing customers (no need to hunt for your first sale!)
3. There's a team and systems already in place
4. You can see the actual numbers, not just projections

Here's the kicker - while it might seem harder because of the upfront investment, it's actually LESS risky than starting from scratch. You're buying something with a track record, real assets, and existing relationships.

But hey - you've got to be smart about it. Do your due diligence, understand what you're buying, and make sure you've got some dry powder left after the purchase. Remember, it's not just about buying ANY business - it's about buying the RIGHT business that you can actually improve and grow.

The path to wealth isn't always about inventing the next Facebook - sometimes it's about buying that local plumbing company that's been around for 20 years and making it even better! I used this platform bizzed ai xyz There are no guarantees in life. I would argue that being employed puts you at greater risk because you could be fired even for things that are not your fault ( ie the business is not going well, or your colleagues or leaders under performing).

If you believe in yourself and can ads value to your customers lives, then your own business is certainly an option to consider. Good for you congrats. How long did it take for you to constantly scale that amount? Yea sounds like a good gig, out and about, different appliances and houses each day, plus transferable skills/useful in personal life at times I would imagine! My primary trade of interest is plumber so not too far from certain aspects of that! $10-$12k US/month is quite handy! All the best to you mate :) [deleted] Interesting, how do you find these suppliers and hatch a deal? Oh wow so I just have to pick one and shoot for the stars. Just shot a DM Judicial Support Counselor for adults with disabilities. The company I work for bills the state at $100 an hour I make about $25 of that. So it can be very lucrative for the owner. Thinking about starting my own company my background was in math so no - but i‚Äôm not the account manager, i‚Äôm the technical sales member (sales engineer).

Most AE‚Äôs i‚Äôve worked with have little background in tech but can sell snow to a snowman and have a degree (in anything). In the beginning. I personally worked 10 years no vacations. Also worked about 350 days a year for 8 of those 10. 

Employee number 1 is still with us. So are 2,3,4 and 5. 

Mostly as ruthless as I can be, I‚Äôm also very generous. Employee 3 went through a divorce some years ago. I paid for her apartment during the transition, as a gift. No pay backs. I always give end of the year cash bonus. Even if we didn‚Äôt make a profit in those early years. 

That‚Äôs just a small sample. 

Side note. The woman I referred to her divorce just last year met my wife. I had a heart issue that landed me in the hospital. She showed up crying and hugging my wife and kids. My wife was like ‚Äúwho the fuck is this lady‚Äù haha No I was just thinking of learning a new trade/skill I have a business in another field but it's so competitive and I want to try something new By lying you get upvotes. Karma. The highest ranked response.  Etc. 

These are all valuable incentives to lie in an anonymous forum. 80% there, useful for me now but still not pretty enough to share with the public.

Which email are you referring to lol, I mean clicking on spam on an email from a newsletter you subscribed to yourself is rare and uncalled for IMO but yea happens.

I am referring to Gmail putting email into the spam folder themselves due to many reasons like overloaded HTML or spammy words It's not my video, moron.

It's an agriculture industry newsletter. If you want to know more and don't want to watch a video, Google the fucking thing. Ads, lead magnets, email funnel, landing pages Tell me something you know inside out that you could sit me down for an evening and talk to me about, so that I‚Äôd understand it too by the end of the night‚Ä¶ 

Could be anything 

How to fix the engine on a Ford Explorer. 

The music of 1950s Sweden. 

The root causes of degenerate behaviour in pet rats. 

Anything. You might think it‚Äôs inconsequential, because it‚Äôs information you‚Äôve picked up over years and you take it for granted. 

I promise there‚Äôs something in your brain that others will pay to know. 

So now all you have is a knowledge arbitrage and a marketing issue. Basically ‚Äústop flailing around in the dark and pay attention, this is how you do ads‚Äù These days, yes - mainly to speed up the technical side. AI doesn‚Äôt have the depth of knowledge/nuance my career has taught me. Yet. I‚Äôve seen consistently better ROI with FB ads over Amazon ads for the past couple of years Hands down, amazing reply. I have nothing to add. Just praise. Hey I got a business idea would you at least want to hear it out I'm currently learning a no code tool called bubble to create small web apps. It's all visual pairing logic (nodes) parts together to create the app function. It's frustrating for sure but pretty rewarding when it all works together. I suppose it's bit similar to game dev since it's not hard coding much either Currently, I have one more person on the team, but before the release, I was a solo developer, yes. Occasionally, I outsourced some tasks.

Game have around 5000 - 7000 sales a month, which is $50000 - $80000 gross. I only get half of it in my pocket. 2 years before any revenue.

The initial boost from Asia was probably because their local media was monitoring new games on Steam and covering interesting ones. This is not what most games experience, so it was essentially luck. Or not, because I made a couple of posts on Reddit before creating a Steam page, which performed well (1k+ upvotes), and some correspondents could simply remember the game and proceeded to cover it. 

Anyway, I do believe it had a significant impact. But not because some people from Asia could find my game, but rather it served as another confirmation of my idea. It motivated me to finish the game. I would run ads only for certain events or right before release to increase traffic momentum and encourage Steam or other platforms/resources to feature the game organically.  Constantly running ads isn't a good idea. However, some influencers saw my ads and covered my game, which also led to wishlist spikes. No way in hell would I move to that shithole with a rapist as president, a country where abortion is illegal, hell no. Is it easy to make cash there? I see many on various socials making it out Email marketing absolutely does work ‚Äî it‚Äôs just not a more powerful starting point (especially cold emails) than speaking to someone. 

Now if you have emails already from prospective leads, then I think it‚Äôs not really relevant to the topic of this thread. It's really hard to go from one location to two. Of course, more revenue and profit would be better if you plan to sell. No worries. And honestly, if you've done the franchise thing, the fully independent thing is so similar that I don't doubt you'd succeed at it, just a little more spend on the marketing side but nowhere near the franchise fees you were paying. One of the best responses I‚Äôve ever heard! Value is perceived‚Ä¶heard that in college and it‚Äôs stuck with me ever since Not even gonna lie i completely looked over him saying 5x Mmm keep them Amazon contractors happy. I have two fleet accounts but they're a pain in the ass. This is mostly B2C. 

Fleets will nickle and dime you. They also want net 30 which kills cash flow. I hate doing fleet stuff. But doing 10k a month would have to be possible with b2c right? Then 5x that I'm guessing would only be possible with b2b type repair? You‚Äôre 100% right. It‚Äôs why my first two days of my digital products and affiliate marketing bootcamp is all about personal branding, target audience, and creating your problem to solution path. Yeah. I‚Äôve found it good to spread payments across platforms. We‚Äôve had stripe shut down accounts temporarily before‚Ä¶ having redundancy is good. Plus giving options gives people less reasons NOT to buy.

Third reason- when you spread it, these payment platforms only send you tax documents if you hit 20,000 in rev on your 1099k‚Ä¶ Sure. You can Direct message me if you have questions.¬† Yeah but this only matters for the least skilled/competent workers. A skilled or competent person can easily find new work. Self employment is only
More resilient after years of it Thanks! It took me 3 full months with lots of ups and downs. You have to focus on your inputs, and the outputs will manifest themselves. Very cool! Gonna take a look! I have no degree so I‚Äôm guessing I should enroll into school and pick a major for this. That‚Äôs interesting. What state are you in? It can be lucrative but there‚Äôs lot of red tape/bureaucracy and state oversight but it‚Äôs helpful and fulfilling. A true win, win. Much appreciated on the details in your response. Although being firm is apart of the process, it‚Äôs nice seeing the generousity to your employees. 

Glad everything is working out for you guys, hope your health is better. :) [removed] Karma has no value irl. Like what are you gonna do with it?

Incentive for lying is close to zero on anonymous forums, because there is now way you can really benefot from it. You aren't going to impress anyone because you are anonymous. You aren't going to gain traction and start selling courses on how to get rich, because you are anonymous. Even upvotes, aren't really doing anything, because u r anonymous. I‚Äôve noticed it has more to do with the IP source of the mailsever.. I could be wrong, üòë but if you host your mail server on a shared server with like 100 other client sites on it‚Ä¶ any one of them could have been blacklisted ‚Ä¶ and then your email will automatically go to spam. I migrated to google business suite ‚Ä¶ fixed it [removed] I have ideas people want! What did you use to create these books?¬† Yes. I'm all ears. Ah, so you know all about it then. You‚Äôll definitely have to learn unique nodes for the programs and workflows you‚Äôre doing, but I imagine what you‚Äôre doing would be highly transferable to game dev.

It‚Äôs def tough. I‚Äôm learning blender and geo nodes is def one of the more frustrating tools. Rewarding for sure though Great stuff. 

Apart from making a good product, in this case, a good game, how important was in your case ad expenditure? Specially for the PC game 

And, how long did it take for the game to start making decent money?

The PC game looks very chill btw, I'll probably buy it soon haha That's a great point Easier is relative. I think we are a little less regulated than other countries in regards to marketing but I wouldn‚Äôt have that comparison for every country. 

I will say is if you have a service that people need and the drive to sell it, there is plenty of money to be made. 

I‚Äôm not gonna say I‚Äôm an expert in the matter but I could talk about this forever and not get tired. Agreed, was just making a point on ""Better"" lol. But quite few have made a decent living spinning up and out businesses. Yes that's right. It's context based (e.g. umbrellas when its raining, face masks in a pandemic, status flex to impress a potential partner, etc), and its subjective (your experience, cultural background, political persuasion, religion, etc).

So perhaps the question could be rephrased to: do you provide enough value to a certain quantity of people that makes your business viable. Thanks for the response. I live in Pakistan, I am a developer and AI/Automation engineer. I wanna launch so many things but get hold due to payment systems as systems like Stripe/Paypal ain't available in Pakistan. On top of it I suck in sales/marketing. I found https://fastspring.com/ but not sure how reliable it is. Just sent you a message Or discuss it here so everyone can benefit? You can argue you case all you want.

Being a wage slave suits most people for various reasons. However, there are other options for those who have the fortitude to be a business owner and desire more control over their work and build up equity in their business, and I would argue, more income security. I‚Äôm in northern CA, and ya there‚Äôs a lot of compliance we have to follow especially since we‚Äôre working with a vulnerable population. Disabled and add on top of that being in trouble with the law. 10 to 12 hours per day. Most weeks I put in 70 to 80 hours. I‚Äôm taking about Reddit karma. 

If you don‚Äôt see the value of accruing upvotes, or the chemicals that released in your body when you receive favourable responses, or the value of having the highest ranked response, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. 

The main issue with your responses logic is that you falsely assume that anonymity precludes a person from making money or accruing financial/ social capital. 

Reddit clearly understands the value, that‚Äôs why they have the incentives in place in the first place. Yes, that's true, but then the promotion tab is another ball game Correct, I am generally a helpful person but have zero time for fools and people who need to be spoonfed when the answers are in front of them. Ok so I'm from a third world country where employing people is so cheap so I taught of a crazy idea if I had a friend abroad who's good at pitching and getting remote jobs we could make lots of money let me explain for example you get a full time remote job that pays $1500 per month I can get well educated people with degrees in computer science book keeping or whatever to do the work for $500 and me and you would each make $500 every month as long as the job continues the more jobs we get more money we make there a millions of unemployed people I'll never run out of people to give the work too Thank you :)  

Marketing is very important. I doubt the game could make this amount without ads or other marketing activities.



The game starts making money as soon as you start selling it if it is a buy-to-play PC game. For free-to-play, it is different and depends on the monetization model. Yes, I know, I am self employed lol Yes, it seems to be a lot. It is a might be small niche but if you think you can get a foot in the door with the state or any local agencies or programs I would say go it. Open your own agency, I am sure there more than enough work. Jesus, I underatand that you were talking abkut reddit karma, I underatnd context. 

I also underatand the chemicals released, I make living woth social media. And if we were talking about other social media (IG, FB, LinkedIn,....) i agree with you, constructing a lie is a way that potentially can create a huge benefit for you (assuming noone figures out u r lying). 

Here on reddit? Not really. You can benefit from high carma, ofc, especially if you use your account for affiliate. So I gove you that you can make money thanks to reddit, howeve i still believe that saying truth here can help you donit way faster.

Talking about social gain, you can't really gain that here. I mean sure, you can feel good about yourslef after the upvote (I personally dgaf but whatever flies ur boat) but noone know it's you, so no social gain.

And mainly, why wouldn't you lie about making $10k/month? 
1. It is doable
2. While it isn't exactly small amout of money, statistically speaking 1 person in ~6,5 people in US is making that or more. Hinestly quite likely that few people like that comment on this. There‚Äôs an entire industry based on this exact idea, it‚Äôs called outsourcing and it‚Äôs perfectly legal as long as you‚Äôre transparent about it. From what I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs quite a competitive market though. This already exists in many ways. Nothing is really stopping you except it's probably not legal I think the biz idea guy wants to do it secretly.

Your example with the MTB pedals is exactly the kind of thing this system would help prevent. It‚Äôs not fair to honest customers, and it hurts trust in the marketplace. This is something I‚Äôm actively",,"expensive, issue",,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1hy6pc5/the_900_billion_problem_tackling_the_online/,The $900 Billion Problem: Tackling the Online Returns Crisis,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve been reflecting on a significant challenge in e-commerce and wanted to gather insights from this community. Apologies if this feels repetitive. I‚Äôve shared similar thoughts in other groups, but the issue seems too critical not to be discussed further.

The value of items returned annually is around $900 billion, and many non-defective products never get resold. Instead, they end up in landfills or require costly processing for repackaging, restocking, and labor.

One potential solution I‚Äôve been exploring is a marketplace for open-box returns. The idea is straightforward:

* Non-defective returned items would bypass warehouses entirely.
* They would be shipped directly from the person initiating the return to a new buyer at a discounted price.

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts:

* Challenges: What obstacles do you foresee with a model like this?
* Opportunities: Are there other angles or solutions I should explore?
* Experience: Have you encountered or worked on similar systems? What did you learn?

This is still in the concept stage, but I‚Äôm speaking with retailers who see value in the idea if executed properly. Your feedback would be invaluable as I refine this further.

Thanks in advance for your time and insights!","It is a huge problem and cost for all retailers.

Problems - folks seal shit, so returns even ""unopened"" need to be verified, this could be done by video prior to authorizing the return or as part of the process someone needs to ""ok"" the package. 

I buy a ton of shit on amazon that was returned - seems to be hit or miss. ""Non-defective returned items"" - Amazons greed of trying to sell every used item they touch as ""refurbished"" when they are def not, has already ruined the credibility/value of buying anything that isn't new and sealed.

""They would be shipped directly from the person initiating the return to a new buyer at a discounted price."" - Well it is cool that I got a free PS5 but the buyer i sent a brick in a PS5 box won't be so happy I'm guessing I have a friend who was dealing with over $80k in monthly returns who attempted to start a business as you describe, from an unhappy customer to the next. The problem was the condition of what many consumers were shipping was not acceptable to many of the next recipients. Many people were shipping things with missing or damaged or unclean parts in miscellaneous boxes. Essentially, you end up entrusting your customer/brand experience to a disgruntled customer. It did not work for them, but perhaps you can solve some of the issues. I agree it sounds good on paper. One of the biggest concerns would be ensuring that returned products are actually in ""like-new"" condition. Even if the items are non-defective, there's a risk of damage during the return process or from wear and tear. Ensuring quality control would be essential, and it may require some kind of inspection or verification to make sure the item is still suitable for resale. Similar business model at Slibuy . com There's a company behind mine that deals with this problem. They have [a machine they hire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUxG_afoqaA) that smashes the merchandise and deems it useless for dumpster divers.

> You might also enjoy this sub   https://old.reddit.com/r/DumpsterDiving/ This is a great opportunity, keep going with it. People are mentioning the issue of theft, but you can probably find or gather data on fraud rates by various items/category/zip code... And then use it to manage your risk.  
  
I don't think warehousing is actually that big of a problem if you can get your products in existing brick and mortar stores / buildings. I'm led to believe there's a lot of unused business space right now. I'd use this but it would have to integrate with our 3PL.
Even better would be if you had a warehouse buying all the open box items from us. I like this idea. I am an e-commerce seller that deals with a lot of returns.  Mostly just preference (size). Are return policies standardized/reinforced by law? Check out Rebound, its a scale up company in Europe and they focus solely on ecommerce returns I‚Äôve seen companies just sell pallets of returned items because the manpower to go through, verify condition, repackage and resell was bigger than the profit margin on the product itself, so maybe if you have a dedicated product line and dedicated suppliers and possibly direct ops for products to ensure their condition then maybe you could do something‚Ä¶ but unless it‚Äôs high margin items, you‚Äôd end up wasting your time just to bid to the lowest buyer. Remind me Potentially you could hold repayment for the item in escrow till buyer confirms condition. This is an interesting idea with a lot of potential! A few challenges come to mind:

1. **Trust and quality assurance**¬†‚Äì Buyers might worry about the condition of items since they wouldn‚Äôt go through retailer checks.
2. **Logistics**¬†‚Äì Coordinating shipping directly between customers could be tricky, especially with fragile or high-value items.
3. **Fraud**¬†‚Äì Ensuring sellers accurately describe the item's condition might require some safeguards.

That said, this could be a game-changer for reducing waste and giving returns a second life. Maybe focusing on specific product categories, like electronics or clothing, could help test the waters. Offering buyer protections (e.g., refunds if the item isn‚Äôt as described) could also build trust.

Looking forward to seeing where you take this idea! I'm currently using a glorious gaming mouse (brand new) where the left mouse isn't working quit properly. it clicks, but you cant click and drag (press and hold) very long before it releases even when the finger is down.

  
This to say, how are you going to test ""non-defective"" products? You'll be testing everything and won't notice whatever defect caused the return in the first place. So you'll have your own problems with selling shit people want to return to you, or leave you bad reviews because they bought a ""non-defective"" tv you thought worked only to find out it randomly shuts off after 10 minutes. It's called sometimes old fashioned is just better. As weird as it sounds... I miss standing in the return line at Fry's Electronics awaiting the scrutiny of a worker as they pondered over and examined whatever thing I happened to be returning.

Screw Amazon for killing Fry's, damn them for trying to profit off of used shit, and in the end, I think the idea will just be another way to squeeze out every last dime and drop from the 99 percenters.

PSA: STOP BUYING SO MUCH SHIT... and less of it will there be to return. Well the biggest issue you will have is changing consumer habits. Most today most people are geared to having the newest thing and that second hand is bad. Your idea for a marketplace for open-box returns is promising.

**Challenges**: Logistics, trust issues, and integrating with retailer systems. **Opportunities**: Focus on sustainability, offer quality checks, and partner with brands for exclusive deals. **Experience**: Similar models work with clear communication and quality assurance.

Execution will be key, but it could address a significant issue in e-commerce. Restocking fee + shipping fee solves that problem entirely. What you wont solve is the real issue: greed, by wanting to keep the customer‚Äôs dollars in accounts and accrue daily interest on it. Other side of the coin is the crazy consumerism that customers feel like is their RIGHT. change the human behavior instead of patching a pseudo problem. Customers often lie about the state of the return. They'll return worn and damaged goods ""as new"". Great point! When someone returns an item in good condition, they could upload a picture, which we‚Äôd use to update the platform with the current package image. It can then be listed as ""open box"" with a note about potential damage. Returns are indeed a big cost for retailers! I hear you, and I completely get the concern. Ensuring transparency and trust is key, and I‚Äôm thinking of adding steps like photo verification, clear condition labels, and removing bad actors who misuse the platform to prevent issues like this. Thanks for sharing that insight, it‚Äôs definitely a challenge. Adding systems to validate the products before shipping is something I plan to implement to address those issues. Would it be okay if I DM you to connect with your friend? I‚Äôd really appreciate learning from their experience and gaining insights into what they went through. A feature that will be added to help with this is when a buyer requests a return, they‚Äôll need to upload a picture, which will be updated on the marketplace. The item will be labeled as an ‚Äúopen box‚Äù with any damage noted (e.g., 5%) and discounted accordingly. This keeps it transparent so users know exactly what they‚Äôre getting.

This will improve trust and fairness on the platform. Thanks for the suggestion! I checked out the website, and while it‚Äôs similar to what I‚Äôm trying to do, my approach is different. I‚Äôm eliminating the auction process and the need for a warehouse. Instead, I‚Äôll partner directly with retailers, and original buyers who request returns will ship directly to the next buyer on the marketplace. Plus, the user interface will be very user-friendly. Thanks for sharing! That‚Äôs an interesting approach to the problem. I‚Äôll check out the subreddit, sounds like a unique perspective! Thank you! I‚Äôm currently working on the MVP, and if it‚Äôs okay, can I DM you to add you to the list of first users when we lunch? You‚Äôd help improve the site and also get access to discounted deals from well-known brands. It will mean a lot u/MotoRoaster Thank you! I‚Äôll implement steps to reduce fraud, like working with retailers who notify me when a return fits the protocol. The item will be listed as open-box at a discount, and the original buyer will ship directly to the next, eliminating warehouses and saving retailers money. Using data like fraud rates by category or zip code is a great idea, I‚Äôll look into that too! Awesome! Is it okay if I DM you? We can definitely integrate with your 3PL, that‚Äôs how the platform is being programmed. The goal is to eliminate packages going back and forth to warehouses, saving retailers money. Instead, the open-box item will go directly to the next purchaser. u/Sir_Bumcheeks Glad you like the idea! I totally understand, size-related returns are common. This platform could be a great way to handle those returns efficiently and give them a second chance with new buyers. Would it be okay if I DM you to discuss further? u/sydneebmusic Return policies are not universally standardized but are often guided by consumer protection laws in specific regions. For example, in the EU, the Consumer Rights Directive allows returns within 14 days for most online purchases. In the U.S., policies depend on the retailer, but most allow returns if products are damaged, defective, or fall within the return window stated at purchase. Retailers set their own terms beyond these legal requirements. u/need2fix2017 Thanks for the insight! The platform I‚Äôm building focuses on open-box items in good condition, like electronics and clothes. Returns go straight from the original buyer to the new buyer, so there‚Äôs no need for repackaging or big warehouses. This keeps everything simple and costs low. Appreciate your thoughts! You‚Äôre absolutely right, changing consumer habits is a challenge. However, stats show that millennials and Gen Z shoppers are leaning toward sustainable choices when buying online. The platform will focus on open-box items, briefly used and returned for reasons like wrong size or change of mind. I‚Äôm all for shifting perspectives on shopping; buying open-box helps the environment by keeping items out of landfills. Let‚Äôs make sustainability the norm! Thank you for the thoughtful feedback! I completely agree, that logistics, trust, and integration are key, and we‚Äôre building the platform with these in mind. Sustainability, quality checks, and brand partnerships are priorities we‚Äôre implementing to make it seamless and reliable. You're right that consumerism is rising, and online shopping will keep growing. U.S. e-commerce sales are expected to hit $1.72 trillion by 2027 (Statista). While restocking fees can help, the real issue is balancing convenience with responsibility. By ensuring open-box items don‚Äôt end up in landfills, we‚Äôre also helping the environment. Changing behavior is tough, but reusing products responsibly is a step in the right direction. Consumers rights would be damaged by pushing a restocking fee and shipping fee. Although amount of miss sold items online is a major part of the issue. 

What do you mean by crazy consumerism? A solution I‚Äôll try to implement is that the platform will only be for open-box items. I‚Äôll make sure all listings have updated pictures and clear notes on their condition. This will help reduce issues like people returning worn or damaged goods as ""new"" and increase transparency. There are also loads of products that have an identical or near-identical cheaper version of the product made out of cheaper materials and people will buy both and return the more expensive ones packaging with the cheaper version of the product inside of it. As an example, I recently bought an expensive pair of aluminum MTB pedals that were ‚Äòlike-new‚Äô from Amazon, but when I received them the box had the plastic version of the identical pedals that are 1/5th the price. Amazon didn‚Äôt give me any pushback when I returned them, but it did leave me feeling like they would think I was the one trying to pull this maneuver and return the plastic pedals while keeping the metal ones. sure DM away and I'll reach out to dude in the meantime Another auction one near me is Nellis auction and they are super busy every day, all day I suppose. Sure! Open box only is for people who like taking risks and are looking for deeper discounts. They are the actual users of the products; they know that when you open a box and try it out once, it doesnt lose much. Hence i come to this point: most of the consumers are not ‚Äòreal‚Äô consumers but they are just shoppers. Shopping just because there is a possibility of shopping. Let me buy a another pair of sunglasses‚Ä¶ because i have cash and dont know what to do with it. Well, producers see this and start pumping more and more and more products hoping that at least one of those will catch you off guard and you will pay for it. ‚ÄúDont worry tho, you can always return for free yaaay.‚Äù What happened now? Greed saw the opportunity and abused it. Consumers saw the opportunity and seized it. Its all nice but the deeper problem lying in the human nature was skipped by both parties. 1 out of 1000 people maybe thinks about landfills and all that but the rest are unaware - willingly or unwillingly. Back to open box: why not charge stocking fees, but make open-box stuff really cheap, like half the price. It will FLY. Why dont companies do that, because scarcity > higher pricing. Purpose of a business is to make its shareholders richer. Environment is not a concern of anybody. Thats the problem. ‚ÄúI have 100 years to live, fuck whoever comes after me - deal with it‚Ä¶‚Äù sorry for wall of text. Buying 10 items and returning ones didnt fit or ones you didnt like the color of. Cost of you physically going to the store to try it all out = cost of restocking (time, gas, parking, frustration in the traffic etc.) OR, that fee will be added on top of the cost of the product and inflate the price even further; which in return will cause even more returns because why wouldnt I order the TV, watch it for 3 days and then return and not lose a single dollar in the process? There is no consumer rights in this thing. Its abusing the availability and competition. That‚Äôs definitely the issue, and I‚Äôve been thinking about a solution for the marketplace. I want to implement a tracking system that spots patterns of people abusing the return process. If someone is caught doing this, like swapping cheaper products for expensive ones, they‚Äôd be removed from the platform.

Your example with the MTB pedals is exactly the kind of thing this system would help prevent. It‚Äôs not fair to honest customers, and it hurts trust in the marketplace. This is something I‚Äôm actively considering to make the experience better for everyone. u/Same-Engineer-9070 whats your take on this ? Businesses are as bad the the customer when it comes to the clothing industry. Non standardised sizing amongst other various leaves me with little sympathy that, it was an obvious issue when it went online. 

It seems you are putting a lot of the blame on the customer when many businesses are just as bad if not worse. Miss selling products, sending out the wrong items altogether and even damage in transit. That's before dealing with delivery companies. u/Ok_Economist3865  You raise a good point. The cost of returns, whether through restocking fees or inflation, can make things complicated. My take is that the goal should be to balance consumer rights with fairness for sellers. I‚Äôll work with retailers to decide what they‚Äôre willing to accept for returns and what they‚Äôre not. At the end of the day, the platform only takes a service fee from the prices set by the retailers. This keeps things fair for both consumers and sellers. Businesses are also real people just dressed up differently. Its all US/WE who do this my man. Everybody is culpable. I think businesses are more evil because they are first movers of this wheel. No matter how much i want one, if there are no businesses selling jackets, i wont be able to buy one. what is your take on ""reselling that product to another consumer, this will be consumer to consumer.  


Consumers A, buy a product from a seller. Consumer A did not like it and seller does not want to take back the returns because the overall process is costly etc. 

Instead of throwing that package to dump, consumer A sells that product to Consumer B at a cheap price.  
  
But there will be a middleman, who will check the package to ensure that it is as described by consumer A (who has become the seller at this point). Then it gets sent to the consumer B.  
You can create your own platform for this.

  


Or just deploy the middle solution to check the product between seller and consumer A. This will reduce the returns in the first place. You charge a small fee for your middle man service to check and verify the product.  


Whats your take on these two ideas ? I think both ideas have potential, and they could definitely be features to add as we grow. Right now, there are a lot of apps that already focus on consumer-to-consumer second-hand purchases, like eBay, Poshmark, and Depop. These platforms allow users to buy and sell items directly. For now, my focus is on streamlining returns and providing a better experience for both buyers and retailers, but I see how your ideas could fit into the future of the platform!  

Thanks so much for sharing your thoughts!",2025-01-10 10:19:34

The quiet backend type, not the one who can build a nice website. I'm pretty good at what I do and have a stable job.

I have never started any business myself nor have thought about it in a serious way. My entourage is similar to myself, doing office jobs and be done with it. I usually have ideas here and there but they always die inside my head. But this idea I have recently keeps sticking, mostly because it's related to my friend's beauty salon business that I have investment on. Since I'm involved in the business, I have some insights in the domain that turned out to be a business idea.

The thing is, I don't know where to start. I can do some market research and come up with a business plan, but then what? I can't start a business alone, i prefer having someone with a business mind along with me. Or even someone who can help me with the feasibility of it.

Some people told me to try going to networking events. I'm looking into it. But how do people even do networking? Can I just approach random people and talk about my idea? Sorry if my question sounds dumb but I have never been a social person.  

So, how do people start from an idea? I really want to act on my idea for once, not letting it die out. Even though I fully acknowledge that it likely won't lead to anything, I want to try. 

Any insights would help, even unsuccessful ones. Thanks for helping.","Go to ChatGPT and ask it to create a 5 year business plan for your idea with annual milestones.   Read what it comes out with and start refining it with more prompts until you get a plan that feels good for you.   Then start asking more in depth questions   ‚ÄúWho are the five groups of people I should test the idea on?‚Äù  ‚ÄúHow do I figure out how much people might pay for it?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat are the 3 most important things I should focus on this quarter?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat are five similar but better ideas should I consider?‚Äù   ‚ÄúWhat other products and businesses are similar to this?‚Äù   It‚Äôs not perfect but it will paint a pretty good picture for you to follow and refine.

The secret to entrepreneurs is being brave.   No one is going to hold your hand.  No one is going to pick up the ball when you drop it.  Many will tell you you‚Äôre an idiot and it‚Äôs a stupid idea.   Hopefully you can find some other people who encourage and support your effort but at the end of the day only you can make it happen. I usually look for ideas similar to mine or in the same field. I use platforms like Reddit, YouTube, and LinkedIn to find these ideas.

Some tools I use for research include [Hustle HQ ](https://magic.beehiiv.com/v1/8165d72d-c0d0-4355-9f80-10af60ecceff?email={{email}}&utm_source=Ent843pm&utm_medium=Reddit), [Gummy search ](https://gummysearch.com/) (free and paid), [Glimpse](https://meetglimpse.com/), and [ExplodingIdeas](http://ExplodingIdeas.co).

My first step is to figure out where my clients spend their time. It could be at a networking event, on Instagram, or on LinkedIn.

If you‚Äôre at a networking event, try to connect with people. Introduce yourself clearly and ask about their business. The more questions you ask, the better you‚Äôll understand what they do and how they do it.

If there‚Äôs a chance to pitch your idea, go for it. If not, don‚Äôt force it. Instead, exchange contact details, like business cards. Later, when the time is right, you can reach out.

Make sure your idea is well thought out with clear examples. Everyone has ideas, but having a product or a solid plan will help you convince clients to buy from you.
I hope this helps you. First off:

All a business does is trade a product/service (that helps people solve a problem) for money. So before you begin ask if what you're trying to sell can help people.

The best way to learn to do. First you need to discover the niche of your business, and then do market research to see

1. Demand for your idea
2. Competition
3. Scalability

All you have to do is figure out what your competition is lacking in and then outperform them. Ex. lower prices, better quality, faster processing times, nicer interactions with customers, etc.

Step 2 is figuring out branding and capital. You need to be able to advertise your business to the audience in your niche without breaking the bank. To do this you could:

1. create a personal brand (requires someone to be the face of the brand) (voiceovers work too)

This is the easiest way to grow reputation for ecommerce because people love to watch and support startup stories. Especially if the brand is helping people improve their lives.

Film yourself starting the brand. This will:

1. Attract people in your niche
2. Find supporters who want your products/services
3. Give you a better idea of whether or not you should invest in the business or start something else.

Make sure to stay away from planning and planning and planning and then executing. Instead use trial and error to build data. Once you hit a winning product, service, ad strategy, take that and go to the moon.

For business operations use chat GPT.

Consider trying these steps. Background: I've been technical co-founder of a startup. Have been through 2 multi-billion dollar IPOs and 2 multi-billion dollar acquisitions. Also a lot of failures.

That aside, there's really not much that a beauty salon can need:

Scheduling of employees

Scheduling of customers 

Ordering supplies and keeping track of inventory

...I can think of a few other things but this isn't a giant complex space.

Given that, what I'd do, if I were you, is build something for your friend's business specifically. Don't even worry about anything else. You can use something like Retool or whatever else you prefer to construct the front-end. Or even just basic HTML and old school python. It sounds like you'd have the API side covered. Whatever you do, keep it incredibly simple and focus on what your friend needs. If you can provide something that they can use and derive some value from, you can upgrade the system to support multi-tenancy and then find one additional customer, which is already a huge leap in terms of system complexity and requirements. Grow this thing organically and carefully making sure each person is happy and deriving value and that you can scale the business in a way that doesn't require custom code for each new person.

Good luck, this is fun stuff. By doing it.  
  
But you can't right now? Why not? Solve that.  
  
Now there's another reason you can't? Solve it.  
  
You realize there are a bunch of obstacles now. Which ones are actually keeping you from doing the business? Solve those.   
  
Get to actually doing the business. All the research in the world will improve the business. But the most important work is the work that actually gets you to doing the business. No sense in optimizing a business that doesn't exist. Starting from an idea can feel overwhelming, especially if you're not naturally outgoing. It's great that you want to act on this one! Networking events can be a good start‚Äîjust approach people with curiosity rather than pitching right away. Share your idea when it feels natural. Also, consider joining online communities or startup groups to connect with business-minded folks. Partnering with someone who complements your skills is a smart move. Remember, every step you take is progress.. You could read Lean Startup and look at some YC videos.

The point is the idea is just the begin.

You have to talk to people and test your ideas. So searching really where are they, what are they need...  


Think finding solutions, and not building a technology.

Good luck. If you want to learn from examples ‚Äî read Failory, listen to startup podcasts. Read Paul Graham, indie hackers, The Mom Test summary etc. Starting from an idea can feel overwhelming, but here‚Äôs how to approach it:

1. **Validate Your Idea**: Talk to potential customers or do competitor research to ensure there‚Äôs demand.
2. **Market Research & Planning**: Research your competitors, create a simple business plan, and define your USP.
3. **Find a Partner**: Since you‚Äôre more technical, look for a business-minded co-founder. Try networking events or platforms like CoFoundersLab.
4. **Start Small**: Create a simple MVP and test it with real users. Gather feedback and iterate.
5. **Learn the Basics**: Read business books or take online courses to gain more entrepreneurial knowledge.

The key is to take small steps and test your idea before diving in. What part of your idea excites you most? I think you should validate the idea first. I validated my idea my reaching out to people in my contacts (50 of them) and offering them my solution, I got 4 clients interested and I adjusted my idea based on their feedback Well For me, Its naturally simple, I use a sheet of paper (Not technology/Notes etc..) and write down all my thoughts down on that paper, This include's the idea, the resource's needed, Funding, Market stratergies etc.. and i plan it out! It takes around 20min for the initial draft and when something else pops into my head, I do the same thing. This is so helpful for bringing idea's to life, Unrelated, But if you ever need graphical help, drop me a DM and we can bring your idea's to life graphically. It's possible to start a business on your own. 

  
I help first-time entrepreneurs find a perfect & profitable niche for themselves. If you already have a clearly defined niche, I can help you validate the same and maybe do an MVP pilot to test the market. Feel free to DM me.

So here's mine:

Every business is based on a problem found in the market.

So what problem do you solve?

When you find that problem you need to know if it's worth wasting time on it or not. Using this frame work called the 4Us

Unworkable: are the consequences of these problem so big that someone might die or get fired for it in case of a B2B idea.

Unavoidable: is your problem Soo fundamental that they have no other choice then to comply.

Urgent: is your problem a top #1 in their priority list? If not is it at least top 3 if not, will it go up or down the list by time.

Underserved: who many people are there serving this problem? Are you the first person? (Notice here that it doesn't have to be the same business as you, it's any solution your market have for that idea, for example: Training, and fat suction operation solve the same problem, high body fat)

Then when you find that good problem to solve you need to find a solution right?

Then you can start using this 3Ds

Which is:

1. Disruptive
This means your value proposition introduces a significant change that challenges the status quo. It solves a problem in a way that others haven‚Äôt.  
Example: Uber disrupted traditional taxis by letting people book rides through an app.


2. Discontinuous
This means your offering is a big leap forward compared to existing solutions. It‚Äôs not just a small improvement‚Äîit‚Äôs a game-changer that creates a new way of doing things.  
Example: The iPhone was discontinuous because it combined a phone, internet browser, and media player into one device.


3. Defensible
This means your value proposition is hard for competitors to copy. You have something unique, like technology, a patent, or a loyal community, that makes your offering strong and sustainable.  
Example: Tesla‚Äôs defensibility comes from its advanced battery tech and established charging network.

In short:  
-Unworkable: the problems consequences are so big
-Unavoidable: you don't have another choice that to fix the problem
-Urgent: do you need to solve the problem now or later
-Underserved: how many out there solve that problem
-Disruptive: shakes up the market,  
-Discontinuous: offers a major leap forward,  
-Defensible: protects your advantage from competitors. Alright, here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd approach it:

1. Find an idea: Decide if it solves a real problem or if it‚Äôs just something people would buy for fun. Fun is fine as long as it can sell!


2. Check out the competition: Analyse their products‚Äîfigure out what they‚Äôre doing well and where they fall short.


3. Build your product: Make it similar enough so people don‚Äôt have to start from scratch to understand it, but improve it massively in terms of user experience and productivity.


4. Understand your market: Find out where your competitors are selling and who their ideal customers are.


5. Market and sell: Go after similar customers and platforms. Scrape leads and start reaching out. I personally prefer cold calling‚ÄîI dedicate an hour a day to it. Alternatively, find resellers or hire people better at selling than you.


 I‚Äôve seen people fail because they didn‚Äôt consider these steps. I‚Äôm a self-taught dev with an engineering and math/physics background, but I also grew up on the streets learning a lot about people and communication. 

A friend of mine, who‚Äôs an amazing backend engineer, built a fantastic product but couldn‚Äôt sell it because he absolutely hates interacting with people (even with his employees). The product failed, and the company went under.
I even offered to take 51% of the company to handle the business side (with full decision-making control) and turn it around, but they refused. Big mistake.

So, most important parts you need to understand:

-Know what you can do and what you can‚Äôt.

-If you can afford it, pay someone to cover the areas you‚Äôre weak in‚Äîthis keeps your equity intact.

-If not, find a capable partner, but don‚Äôt make emotional decisions when choosing them.


Follow these steps, and you‚Äôll have a much better chance of success. Why can't you do it yourself? Part of owning a business is, unfortunately, learning new things that you suck at. You can validate it by building for the salon and getting that salon to use it. If that salon won't even use it... then your idea is no good. Work with a co-founder or hire someone who has a business background, as the idea might be brilliant, but it could fail in implementation

Study the reasons for startup failures to learn how to avoid making the same mistakes By not overthinking. Had an idea? Just go. It might be bad, but the sooner you go, the sooner you'll find out, and sooner you'll gain feedback. Get out of your head. Thanks, I actually built stuffs for the salon already and they work well. The idea I have is more general and doesn't apply for a single salon. It's rather like skyscanner for beauty market. My idea is end-user oriented so it's more difficult to boot up, but I guess I can make a prototype. Thanks, that means a lot, I will find some communities where I can connect with people. Great suggestion, thanks. I think I really need to work on 1 or 2 first. Yeah I do think so as well. I'm thinking about infiltrate beauty groups on Facebook and gather feedbacks. Wow thanks, umm that sounds big. My idea is more of an improvement, helping people find a salon more easily while helping salon be more visible online. Of the 4Us, I might have only the 4th one. Thanks, I have 1 and 2 already. I'm fully aware of my capabilities and good thing I don't have a big ego. It's just that I don't know how and where to get the right people, yet. I'd love to find someone like that, I just don't know where and how. Ah, I see. Well, you're going to need to build scrapers and data collection agents galore and you'll be able to build a TON of stuff to prove things out without even end users or a front-end beyond Postman or something like that.

Beyond this the product does seem to build itself - once you have some data, integrations, etc you can see what might be most interesting for folks looking for services, build a service catalog, etc. The big questions that are non-technical are how to market this; how to create visibility and drive traffic. This is where things like SEO, marketing, partnerships, and the like come in and where I think your question really lies.

Fun stuff, good luck. It's not that you don't have it, it's that you didn't see it yet, for example your idea is urgent for the salons.

here's why:

See my friend a market is either expanding or dying.

For example: the AI is and expanding market. Newsletters are a dying market.

So and for a business (salon) to be healthy or profitable as you can call it.

It need to be growing higher or at the same rate as the market.

And the market of barbers and beauty salons is a growing market i guess, due to the high demand from people and the trends online, people racing to look beautiful and handsome.

So which means the beauty salon need to follow the wind and expand.

Let's say there's two barbers facing each other.

One is using your software or service and getting reach online, which means they will get more customers, and those customers they will refer others and others and others.

Which creat an endless loop of clients (if he was an excellent barber)

Which means that the second guy is dying because he didn't reach online.

This means that this is Unworkable, and of they don't reach online first they can fall behind, than this is urgent.

And In the future there will be no business with no online reach, so this is unavoidable.

And you can even use these 4Us as a pitch for the salons.

Hope this is helped. Use LinkedIn, local events, networking, or visit businesses. Depending on your needs, you might not require someone from the industry but someone to explain the business logic or help grow the business. For example, I‚Äôm active in three companies: one I built from the ground up, one where I‚Äôm an investor helping with sales, and another where I‚Äôm training a relative to expand.

Figure out what you need‚Äîbusiness logic, compliance, sales, or branding. Decide what to outsource and what to handle internally. In your case, look for someone with strong industry connections. In B2B, it‚Äôs often about who you know. Pitch your idea simply and find common ground. I do not know what the industry you are in, so If possible send me a brief about your project in Dm to see if I can recommend someone to help you Surely I can build stuff but who am I going to prove things without a front end? At the end of the day the idea is for people to pick a salon more easily and for salons to be more visible online for their clients.

I totally agree on the non technical parts. That's why I think I need to connect with someone more business wise. Ah I see. I might have understood urgent too literally. Let me rethink about it your way. Great advice, thanks for your help! You can prove out the full flows technically without a front-end. You can then build a front-end using something super simple like PHP to get it in front of people to do usability testing. Beyond that you'll need to ramp up or find a front-end buddy. But that's just engineering. The real trick is the non-technical bit where you need to find someone marketing/business oriented like you said. I don't have deep thoughts there - I personally have friends who work in these areas, you'll need to network. Be critical in thinking about it, sit with yourself and start thinking 

what is that makes the consequences of my problem Soo bad that it could lead to bankruptcy?

What is that makes my problem so fundamental that the salon owners can't say ""no I don't need it?

Is the problem I'm trying to solve on the top of their priority? 

Is it waking them up all night? 

If not, 

is it gonna be there that way in the future?

Is my problem being served by other solutions?

Can they find any other solution? 

Like IG, FB, TickTock? 

Is yes what is there inconveniences?

OP keep doing what you‚Äôre doing. When I was 16, I played video g",,saturated,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1hy4lc0/roast_my_startup_i_can_take_it/,Roast My Startup: I Can Take It,"So, I‚Äôm Yutish, an 18-year-old founder who dropped out of school at 16 to chase this wild dream of building something meaningful. My startup,¬†**StarCy**, is an AI assistant that‚Äôs supposed to be way better than Siri‚Äîmore human, more helpful, less‚Ä¶ disappointing.



We‚Äôve been working on it for months, and while I think we‚Äôve built something cool, I know I‚Äôve probably made mistakes along the way. That‚Äôs where you come in.



I want you to roast my startup. Be brutally honest. Rip it apart. Tell me what sucks, what‚Äôs cringe, or what you think could be better. Is it the concept? The execution? The fact that I‚Äôve partnered with other AI tools to build it instead of going fully custom?



I genuinely want to know. I‚Äôm not here for sugarcoated feedback‚ÄîI want to learn and make StarCy the best it can be. So, let me have it.



(And if you‚Äôre curious about what StarCy actually does, I‚Äôm happy to share more details or a link to the waitlist.)



Let the roasting begin. üî•","You‚Äôve really given us little to nothing to go off of. Sounds like chatGPT though More human means  what? More helpful how? Less disappointing how? What was not possible with Siri and is possible with yours? What was the problem of Siri that gave birth to StarCy? If im not a Siri user, im not your market already. But those who are your market will like to know what exactly you are doing differently. It‚Äôs ‚Äúsupposed to be way better‚Äù but isn‚Äôt? So just another chat gpt wrapper I don't see anything original here. I'm sorry. 

It's an AI chat bot... I have ChatGPT on my phone already and it's fully featured.

What differentiates your product from others? My largest concern is that you don't have a very strong value proposition & positioning in the first place.

\> way better than Siri‚Äîmore human, more helpful, less‚Ä¶ disappointing.

Good that you at least didn't settle on ""better"" and already described *how* it's better. However, you still have only ""performance features"" going for you. And competing on these as an incumbent never works out when you're building something innovative.

Especially as you're going up against a couple of companies that are immensely well-funded and have no problem attracting the most skilled people on the planet right now. These big players are working day and night on making their assistants more humane and helpful. Claude and [Pi.ai](http://Pi.ai), for example, are already deliberately positioned in that area anyway.

And another really common mistake: you're marketing to everyone (or at least a huge part of the market).

Can you find a group of niche customers that have a specific problem you can solve?  
Can you be ""the only one that does x"" for somebody?

Don't be afraid to target a small market first, and make sure you focus relentlessly on a problem to solve first. All in all, I feel you're a bit too excited about the specific *solution* ‚Äì which is another really common mistake I see in startups.

I hope I didn't go in too hard ‚Äì I highly appreciate what you do and sincerely hope you'll succeed. If you're truly only 18 years old, you'll have plenty of time to be successful with this or another venture. Stop spamming this already, I have seen it poorly received in several subs this morning.

Take the hint, no one wants to read your spam and can see you spamming by viewing your profile.

No one needs what you're offering either. Why does your website have 'industries' in its name? I stopped reading after you dropped out of school at 16. Like that's something to be proud of lol. Is this a pitch, an ad or a roast test? Give us info and not try to sell us your product What's your revenue model? I‚Äôm not your target market although I have experience working in this area. If I was to use Siri then it would most likely because it‚Äôs embedded into Apple‚Äôs ecosystem. It‚Äôs already free to use if you own an Apple device, it‚Äôs integrated into Apple‚Äôs native apps and appliances.

Voice assistants are well established so you have tough competition - take Alexa or Amazon Rufus. Rufus is a good example of a specialised voice assistant in that it takes the knowledge of Amazon‚Äôs product catalog and spits out information to enhance the user experience. Again, Rufus is free. You just pick up the Amazon app and it‚Äôs there.

So then - what reason would this give users to use this? Can it perform a niche task much better than other voice assistants? You really are spamming every sub out there. This is the second post in THIS one in less than an hour.¬† Will you tell me how did you convince your parents for dropping out of school? Just finish your homework lil bro At first, emotion may seem helpful, but what really matters in the long run is, the value it adds. What problem does it solve for me? It needs to be clear. May be you are solving some problem already. But it is not clear at this point of time for me. I just tried it, and it feels great! One suggestion: it would be helpful if it could also provide answers in text form. For example, I asked about an AI beginner course, and having the text or a link to a resource would be really useful. I‚Äôm guessing this might be planned for the full version already.

Wishing you all the best and great success!

I have some quick feedback. Why compare this with Siri? Doesn‚Äôt it seem more comparable to something like ChatGPT? I hope you‚Äôre using some form of OpenAI technology behind the scenes, but in the end, what really matters is the clear value proposition compared to OpenAI. Simply calling it a better agent than Siri doesn‚Äôt feel right‚ÄîSiri has a very specific focus on tasks related to Apple devices.

Are you planning to turn this into a mobile app that can assist with tasks like Siri, but in a more advanced way? Or are you focusing on specific areas? Based on my conversation with it, it feels more like OpenAI, which is more open-ended in its capabilities. Talk to her: [https://starcyindustries.com](https://starcyindustries.com) Alright! I see AI and i'm already disinterested! Not to put you down but the fact that the niche is over-saturated! Everyone wants  a peice of the ""AI"" Cake, If you can be something different and add meaning into an indivudals life. Than your idea's got potential. On an unrelated basis, if your in need of any graphical help with your idea, Drop me a Dm as i help business's with Logo development, 3D product mockups etc..Let me know if this serve's an interest to you. It's actually a Humi AI wrapper. I asked it. Thanks for the questions! Let me break it down:

	1. More Human, More Helpful: StarCy doesn‚Äôt just answer questions‚Äîit actually engages in conversations. Instead of dumping a bunch of links or generic responses like Siri often does, StarCy provides thoughtful, actionable answers and explanations tailored to what you‚Äôre asking.

	2. Less Disappointing: Siri sometimes feels robotic and outdated‚Äîit lacks depth. StarCy is designed to feel more like talking to a real friend who actually understands your context and needs.

	3 .What Was Missing in Siri?: The biggest issue for me was how transactional Siri feels. Ask a question, get a response‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt feel personal or engaging. StarCy focuses on creating a conversational, human-like experience, whether you‚Äôre asking it to summarize an article, organize your day, or just chat for a bit.

	4 .Why StarCy?: Honestly, I built StarCy because I wanted an AI I could actually enjoy interacting with‚Äînot just for commands but for meaningful conversations. I realized there are likely others who want the same thing.

You‚Äôre right that not everyone is the market for this‚ÄîSiri users probably aren‚Äôt bothered by these shortcomings, but for people who want a better, more human AI experience, I think StarCy has potential.

I‚Äôd love to hear what you think‚Äîdoes this answer your concerns, or am I missing the mark? Haha thats funny No, I think you should try it, you'll get a sense what chatgpt isn't. Let me know what you think! Hey, 

\- You don't need to enter any App to start, just say 'Hey Starcy' and start talking (like Siri(

\- Much much human-like conversational compared to chatgpt. (You should try it fro yourself, it's free)

\- v2 has acess to users calener, WhatsApp, picking up calls and talking, booking restaurants, etc. This is when we really start to get real. 

  
I'd suggest you to give it a shot, it's free: [https://starcyindustries.com](https://starcyindustries.com)

Let me know what you think! Thanks so much for the detailed feedback and for taking the time to share your thoughts‚ÄîI really appreciate it. You make excellent points.

You‚Äôre right about needing a stronger value proposition. Right now, StarCy is focused on providing a human-like interaction that doesn‚Äôt just assist but also adapts over time to the user‚Äôs specific needs‚Äîsomething Siri and Alexa aren‚Äôt great at yet. But I see your point about needing to target a niche market more effectively.

I‚Äôm currently exploring niches like solopreneurs who could use a highly tailored assistant for their workflow or students looking for personalized study aids. Do you think these areas could be a good starting point?

Thanks for pointing out the importance of refining both the product and the target market‚Äîit‚Äôs invaluable advice. 

And no worries, you weren‚Äôt too hard at all! It‚Äôs feedback like this that helps me grow. We plan to go deeper into the robotics game, building hardwars robotics in future. sure Hey, you'll better be able to roast if you have more info about the product. We launch v1 for Free in Q1, then in v2 StarCy can start doing stuff like picking up call and talk, whataspp, mails, etc. Then we plan to add subscription model! Thank you for your insights! You‚Äôre absolutely right‚Äîvoice assistants like Siri and Alexa have a strong hold due to their ecosystems. StarCy is aimed at carving out a niche where these assistants fall short. For instance, StarCy focuses on being hyper-personalized and capable of more conversational, in-depth interactions tailored to specific use cases (think learning support, professional assistance, or niche problem-solving).



I‚Äôm curious‚Äîwhat‚Äôs a task or feature you feel these assistants don‚Äôt handle well? Would love your take! Haven‚Äôt seen this on r/sounding or r/poop Appreciate the feedback! The goal isn‚Äôt to spam‚Äîjust trying to engage with different communities to get as much diverse feedback as possible. My bad if it‚Äôs come off the wrong way. I‚Äôll take this into account moving forward. Thanks for pointing it out! If someone believes in you, and you'll do great than support stands firm Just start failing exams intentionally and you'll automatically drop out. Are you planning to? haha, you might wanna read the first line, I dropped out to build this. Thanks anyways Hey, Correct! Defeinaly agree, as the founder, I also didn't want to make just someoen you can talk tom thats so useless, thats not what StarCy is, in v1 which we launch in Q1 StarCy is just the better version of Siri, where she has internet acess so she can get info or dive deep into anything, and shes llm. You got see what we bring in v2, it's just super amazing, she can pick calls and talk, whatsapp, bookings, etc. 

I'd suggest you to try it out, and sign up to know when we launch, Love to get your feedback. [https://starcyindustries.com](https://starcyindustries.com) This has to be the dumbest, silliest and maybe most ignorant comment I‚Äôve seen in my entire life.

‚ÄúAI is saturated‚Äù

I love how this app is free and how some people are so ignorant. It amazes me every single time. 

OP keep doing what you‚Äôre doing. When I was 16, I played video games for 6 hours a day. School was boring. I talked to girls and played cod. 

I did nothing with my life up until 22. I decided to drop out of uni and start a business. Fast forward a couple years, I‚Äôm making $300,000+/month inshallah. 

You have a head start on me in age. Trust me, keep pushing, keep failing. You‚Äôll get the win one of these times. I feel like you are more interested in a conversationalist AI bot. Figure out who (as a big customer group) are looking for a similar bot. Old people services? Children services? Definitely not ‚Äújust do the command Siri!!!11‚Äù people. I would forget comparing it to Siri and just Underline this conversation-capable aspect more. Hello do you want to connect with some investors to be backed? I see. that wasn't clear from my interactions with your website and your chatbot. So this will be running on what device, our phones? Running as a background service? Or do you have plans to make your own hardware?

I'm not 100% sure on this, maybe do some research, but I have a feeling Google and Apple are going to not allow you to do this. Think about it. Your app needs to run in the background 24/7 with microphone permissions and listening to everything everybody says around that device. Privacy nightmare.

Seems like also you're trying to get into the AI Agent space. That's very exciting area and I am also exploring product ideas in that space. The Omi wearable AI comes to mind. Still, the points you mention - adaptability, integration, generally being more human-like - is exactly what all the big ones are working on as well. These are not stand-out features that are unique, so the only way to win on these axes is to out-perform the competition. Even if you could, you'd have a hard time competing - and you'd really have to be 10x better than the others. 

You're approach to tailor to niches is far more promising, though you should become much more specific (also, these niches are getting crowded fast). Most important though: Start with a problem worth solving, not with your solution. Going solution-first rarely ever works (it mostly works if you've got truly ground-breaking technology that almost nobody is able to build yet). 

You'd need to be really specific (e.g., graduate students in your city, small business owners in rural India, etc.), find a way to approach them, and then get a really good understanding of how they think and what they struggle with (best by observing, not directly asking them ""what problems they have""). 

Once you've identified the biggest issues - then, and only then, can you demo them a solution and see if anyone cares to sign up or use it. Absolutely yes. With info like who would be your target, a MVP and possibly some in-depth analysis of what are you going to do in the next year Those tasks you listed that your product ‚Äòcould‚Äô be better at doing compared to other voice assistants aren‚Äôt really niches. From what I understand, it is more trying to be a jack-of-all-trades for chatting and answering queries, not so much hyper specialising in one problem area. 

Again most of these chatbots I mentioned are part of existing ecosystems - they serve to enhance the overall UX or draw new customer profiles to use another targeted functionality; the voice assistants are rarely the centre piece. If you‚Äôre asking me to critique other AI voice assistants, it‚Äôs hard to find one other than they‚Äôre good enough to do what they need to do; they don‚Äôt wow me beyond that or scream real ‚Äòinnovative value‚Äô.

I guess one area these kinds of voice assistants could lack in is offline functionality. It‚Äôs a bit of a niche use - however some assistants truly only rely on online models to even function. Offline models run the drawback of taking a ton of space to be remotely useful, so they‚Äôre not widely used. Give it a minute. Just kidding! Start by having a clear business plan and developing a proof-of-concept to ensure viability. You can easily do this during your summer break. Ahh Of course! Would expect this comment from a reddit name like yours. 

Claim i'm hating on his idea but i'm delivering on what his exactly asked for. Not hating, Just giving him my opinion.

Fact you commented on my post rather than spending your time doing something else is shocking! 

""A Businessman would never judge others for starting a business"" Yet you judge, Really tends to contradict your statements. Hey, Tell me more, my DMs are open! Hey, 

Users will have to give access to StarCy to run in the background so it listens to the wake word (if you worry about data, you should read our privacy policies page). There are many apps that just run on background, it's nothing to do with the companies unless the users gives the permission to access running on background. 

Yeah man, getting into AI space is big part. 1. You‚Äôre hating. It‚Äôs irrelevant if he asked for your opinion. You‚Äôre still hating. It‚Äôs fine to hate if the idea is bad. His idea is decent. 

2. You‚Äôre a liar. You think AI is over saturated. That‚Äôs like saying websites are saturated during the 2000 boom lol. 

3. You make logos lil bro. Don‚Äôt talk about ai if you‚Äôre entire skill set is making a logo. 

4. Don‚Äôt lie and misquote me. Don‚Äôt put quotes on made up words. I never said any of that you disgusting liar. 

I can tell you‚Äôre a kid or some bum who has 0 professional experience in life. If you want genuine advice ditch making business logos and find ways to make businesses money. 

Having a logo ain‚Äôt doing shit bro. Respectfully, from one brother to another, from one Redditor to another, from a millionaire to a bum, for the love of God, do not make logos.",2025-01-10 08:39:11

AI is quietly becoming the new middleman between users and information. The websites that worked hard to rank #1 on Google? Their content is now being served directly through AI, with no credit or traffic.

This feels like 1998 all over again. Remember when Yahoo & AltaVista were kings? When SEO meant getting listed in alphabetical directories? (Fun fact: Companies would name themselves ""A Something"" just to rank first! )

Then Google arrived and changed everything. Links became the new currency, like citations in academic papers. The old giants fell, and a new era of SEO was born.

I think we're at a similar inflexion point now. AI is doing to Google what Google did to Yahoo. The rules of digital visibility are being rewritten in real time. BUT here's the kicker: While everyone's focusing on current SEO strategies, the real opportunity lies in understanding where this is heading. 

The question isn't ""How do I rank on Google?"" anymore. It's ""How do I ensure my content and brand gets seen in an AI-first world?"" Those who adapt early will win big. Those who don't... well, ask Yahoo how that worked out...

But the first thing I need to do is get clients

But I mean here is a post I used on Facebook 

Hey Neighbors!

I am 15 years old and live in the downtown area if you are looking for someone to wal","advantage, great, recommend",,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1hy3bli/is_it_normal_to_always_think_about_buissness_and/,Is it normal to always think about buissness and how to make money?,"I‚Äôm 15 have a few post about how I‚Äôm gonna do a dog walking buissness but im always thinking about buissness and visualizing it my head especially at school cause i tend to work faster and all more than my classmates and I finsh most work before the teacher has even finished. So I just have a lot of time sometimes and am always thinking. 

Is this normal? ","Not normal for some but for those gfted with the talent. If you cant stop thinking about then maybe you should do something about it. You're 15 so you're still a kid but you can start learning about the rules of businesses. 

Collect books, if books arent your thing, try to watch video platforms that can help you out. Heck, you can try to mirror business men. Build on it Are you acting on your thoughts?

Be careful that you're not just attracted to thinking and talking and not doing. Yeah it‚Äôs normal. I‚Äôm 25 and think about business and money and value of things constantly Yea I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre a dreamer which is super great.

Whenever you stop dreaming and visualizing your success it‚Äôs not a good sign. Absolutely! When you're passionate about something, it's normal for it to occupy your thoughts. It's a good sign that you're driven and motivated. Keep that fire burning! I think it's completely normal at teenage, I see alot of people wanting to do business and the more they engage themselves in business convos, the more their interest in it develops (inc myself). Im so glad I'm 18 and one of those ppl (ppl like you). At 15, my focus was girls/getting laid, parties, concerts, sports.  The more I focused, the better I got (especially at getting laid). 

I didn't worry about work and business until I was old enough to not just worry about it, but to do something about it.

Something worked...
I retired at 58, I'm married 39 years, raised 2 kids (both Gen Z's both w/responsible jobs and both condo owners).
I worked 27 years in tech sales. I've owned /partnered in 3 companies 2 failed.
Despite some health stuff, life is good. Sometimes it's great! Been that way since I was 15 and I am now 42. It's not normal, it's exceptional. Congratulations, you're going to be a great businessman in a short time. Keep studying and preparing yourself for business. It is totally normal, but it can prevent you enjoy your life if it becomes obsession. 
Everything should have its limits, same for this. 
If you constantly think about it, saving all the money and just think how to save more and reinvest it‚Ä¶ years passed by and you lose your best years which you can not bring back. 
Its great to save and make your future bright, but dont forget to enjoy every day and celebrate life. No. It's not normal.  
But no one said ""normal"" was the same as ""good"" :)  
  
Only thing you should focus on is what will give you a good life.  
You're very young. Don't scam people to get quick money.  
Also, learn to talk to people, do sales and marketing (rich people's advice).  
  
Best of luck in any case. Hope I my advice was helpful for you Whether its normal or not, its definitely not a bad thing You are ready to start your own business. Just jump in and learn the processes you need in order to execute that business. Dog walking: when are you going to walk them? Where are the clients' houses and how can you make an optimal route? What happens if two dogs don't get along? What if there's an injury? Do you scoop poop as you go or not? Are there local ordinances on curbing dogs? How will you get paid? How will you advertise? How will you schedule your time off? How will you get new clients and know when you are completely saturated? Taxes? LLC? Bank account? Insurance? Hiring help? Etc. all of that is processes that you need to know about and be ready for. But it is fun to think about because if you get it all in place, and do the work, guess what? 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ Totally normal‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre the type of person who loves to stay busy and is always on the lookout for new ideas. At 15, having the drive to think about business and entrepreneurship is a great sign; it means you‚Äôre already taking initiative and not just waiting for opportunities to land in your lap.

If you find yourself with extra time after finishing schoolwork, consider **jotting down your thoughts** in a notebook or note-taking app. That way, you‚Äôre building a record of your ideas, and you can revisit them later to refine or act on them. It might also help you keep your focus during class because you‚Äôll have a structured place to put any random business brainstorms.

The fact that you already want to start a dog walking business is awesome‚Äîsmall, manageable ventures like that can teach you a lot about marketing, networking, and money management. Keep up the brainstorming, and don‚Äôt worry if it feels like you‚Äôre always thinking about business. That constant curiosity can lead to some pretty cool projects down the road! I have been this way my entire life. Normal to me but may not be normal to others. I am also always thinking long term when I make a purchase (how long will this last me and how much money can I make with it). You can especially be this way if you grew up poor. My family was always broke which eventually caused my parents to have a nasty divorce. I knew from an early age I never wanted to be like that, so the grinding and hustling started when I was about 10yo. What a blatant attention seeking post I was just like you at 15. Completely normalised! I feel like business is the new way in which people are coming out of thier shells to chase their true dreams. On an unrelated basis, if your in need of any graphical help with your idea, Drop me a Dm as i help business's with Logo development, 3D product mockups etc..Let me know if this serve's an interest to you. Yes, 

I think about it from the second I wake up from the second I go to bed. Totally normal. Not only is it normal but you are probably lucky and gifted. Never give up, and don't waste it. Depends where it's coming from. If it's coming from insecurity or lack, or perhaps patterns in upbringing, I don't think it's a great thing as it could distract from what your actual purpose and values are yes, why not, wont deny business is a money makin machine and thats why ppl opt for it. Totally normal. Follow your thoughts and dreams. Also, don't wait to start. Your first business will teach you so much. So don't wait. Start today! I think about this all day and everyday. Normal for me. Sounds like you have the ‚Äúentrepreneurial spirit‚Äù which few people actually have. I‚Äôm 17 years old, and I was the same, and I‚Äôm still the same. I‚Äôve decided to focus on programming because my dad always told me that it‚Äôs the future. There were times when I didn‚Äôt go out for months, except for school. I want to tell you that it‚Äôs normal because I believe that this way, you‚Äôll protect yourself from a lot of crap during those years, from drugs to messed-up relationships, and so on. Obsession is key to your dream Yes. If you have so much time to think.. Please think of business that can run without you OR make money while you sleep! That's the ultimate place you wanna be! It will get worse. You‚Äôll make more money, but it will never seem like an enough. 

It‚Äôs like a never ending tunnel where you‚Äôre under light, and there‚Äôs another one 45 feet ahead. 

By the time you get to the next one, the one behind you has burned out, and you‚Äôre looking for the next light. 

You‚Äôll make a lot of money, and others more money than you can keep up with. 

Learn to act to see what will work instead of visualizing it. Once you‚Äôre busy enough, pay someone to keep up with what you‚Äôve built so you can do more. 

I hope this helps. Same thing here, been thinking about business for ages and am worried and literally lose sleep over not being successful. Anything would help, just feel very lost. Yes, it‚Äôs completely normal to be constantly thinking about your business, especially if you're passionate about it. Many entrepreneurs and creative people tend to have ideas and visualize their goals in their minds, even when they're not actively working on them. It‚Äôs a sign that you're driven and thinking ahead.

Being ahead of your classmates in terms of completing work can be an advantage, as it gives you more time to focus on your business ideas. Just make sure you balance school and your business thoughts, so you're not overwhelmed. It's great that you're already thinking about the future and planning your business!

But the first thing I need to do is get clients

But I mean here is a post I used on Facebook 

Hey Neighbors!

I am 15 years old and live in the downtown area if you are looking for someone to walk your dog I‚Äôm here to help, whether it‚Äô is a short walk or a long walk. 

Availability 3:15 pm-6:00pm on weekdays starting Monday, January 20th.
I also do weekends but won‚Äôt be able to do reoccurring walks like I can weekdays.

I have always grown up with dogs. several breeds from 9-90lbs and wanted to try and start offering a service doing something I enjoy.

If you are within a mile or so of the downtown area and interested or have any questions please message me and I will get back to you as soon as possible. 

Friends and Family can supply references upon request. I‚Äôm sorry to hear that but we have a similar story in some ways both my parents are divorced my dad is poor and my mom is middle class with my stepdad but my parents are friends and still talk cause they want to what they can for us but my step fathers ex uses there kids as a tool but yea as much as I love my dad I don‚Äôt want to live the way he does and then be complacent about it Nice where are you now? Yes me too I‚Äôm glad to see so many people have the same thoughts as me as of now my biggest struggle social anxiety What do you mean by that you could maybe explain a little further or simplify I think I might understand you asking if I‚Äôm doing it feel better about myself or because habits and ideas put in my head when I was young I think 

If this is what your trying to say I‚Äôm motivated by wanting to be more and as much as i love my parents they are divorced but don‚Äôt fight and get along fine but my dad is poor and my mom and step father make middle class but I just don‚Äôt want to be complacent like my dad is and don‚Äôt want to work a job my whole life or work one but paying well enough to give financial freedom. And growing up the biggest events were major surgeries/operations divorcing of parents getting a step father being a 2 week coma 

So these are some things that make up my motivation and values but I do it for me and no one else except maybe if i get to a point retire my parents. I also think for my self and don‚Äôt repeat or spew out my parents values and ideas and have my own based on what I have experienced I‚Äôm pretty socal and don‚Äôt get caught in those things and my 2 best friends I have been friends with since kindergarten and we now go to different schools but still do stuff Yea but a healthy amount of course Any Ideas of ones I can do at 15 and not dropshipping Let me tell you something. If you know anything about how Environment works and how it can shape a human being. My friend, you might as well act like you‚Äôre wealthy because You are. I'm a bit confused Not an excuse just a big factors that affect me As much as I can. Currently in the Caribbean on a small island with my girlfriend as she attends vet school. Im not really alloweddddd to work but I do. I also pet sit for students over their semester breaks. I make 10k in 3 weeks from that. I also grow and sell some special plants down here. I‚Äôll have 20-25k when I go back to the US and plan on starting a business was in the service industry Yes since I was 20. I like it. If there are community-specific FB groups, get into those and post the same thing on the days they allow business postings.  If FB doesn't pan out, try NextDoor (which I hate, but some people use it) and then there are flyers you could post and also hanging around dog-friendly coffee shops in the area and talking to the owner, see if you can leave a pile of cards by the register.  Good luck on your business journey!!!  I hope you make a lot of money doing something you enjoy! I am going on 40yo and look back on my childhood. I am so glad and blessed I grew up in the crazy family I had haha. Never let the past and hard times keep you down. You use that as fuel to be a better person and make the world a greater place. Always have a positive outlook no matter how difficult the situation may be. Make the hard times and failures refine you, not define you! Keep that grind going with a positive outlook on life and you will do amazing things. Nowhere mentionable. Life doesn't move the way we want. Just when I was ready to make my life great, I was hit with illnesses. It continued for next 6 years. I am recovering now. But my parents need my care now. Can't leave them at this point and work on my ventures. I typed a short response and then let ChatGPT do the heavy lifting: 

It‚Äôs completely normal to think a lot about something you're passionate about, such as business, especially if you‚Äôre naturally driven, curious, or passionate about entrepreneurship. Many successful entrepreneurs started young and found themselves constantly brainstorming ideas or imagining future possibilities. It‚Äôs a sign of creativity and ambition, which are great traits to nurture.  That itself can be great.

However, it‚Äôs worth considering why this focus on business occupies so much of your thoughts. 

Here‚Äôs why that‚Äôs important:

1) Motivation Matters

If your drive comes from excitement, creativity, or the joy of building something, that‚Äôs a positive foundation. But if it‚Äôs rooted in fear, insecurity, or a feeling of needing to prove yourself (to others or yourself), it might be an issue that leads you down a unfulfilling road.


2) Balance Is Key

At 15, your main focus should be on exploring, learning, and growing. While thinking about business is a great use of time, it‚Äôs also important to experience life in a well-rounded way‚Äîbuilding friendships, discovering hobbies, and learning more about yourself. These experiences will shape your ability to succeed in the future, both personally and professionally.


3) Purpose and Values

The habits you develop now will stick with you. Spending time reflecting on your deeper goals and values (beyond just making money) can help ensure you‚Äôre building something meaningful. Ask yourself:

What kind of life do I want to create?

How do I want to impact others through my work?

What excites me most about this idea?

Practical Steps

To channel your energy productively, you might try:

Writing down your ideas in a journal so you don‚Äôt feel stuck in your head.

Exploring different skills and areas of interest beyond business to broaden your perspective.

Talking to mentors or teachers who can help guide your entrepreneurial spirit.

In short, your interest in business is a great strength, but balance and self-awareness will help 
ensure it leads to long-term success and happiness. Keep dreaming, but don‚Äôt forget to enjoy life and all its other aspects along the way. Hey man, kudos for such self reflection at such a young age.

It sounds like your focus on business right now is coming from the wound around your father being poor & complacent. That's not a bad thing - just a thing to be aware of.   It CAN lead you down a endless road where you keep chasing something but never end up being happy (its simply how the mind can work).


if you‚Äôre feeling driven by ‚Äúescaping‚Äù something from your past (whether it‚Äôs complacency, financial instability, or unresolved family dynamics), it might help to explore those feelings more deeply. Understanding the core reasons behind your desire for success could give you more clarity and help you make choices that feel authentic, not just reactive, in the long run. And that in itself is a key to success. Look at the rich people that are super unhappy - you don't want to be that.

This is usually advice I give to 35-yo's that are stuck in a pattern. So it might be useless for you right now - but I thought it'd be nice to know i guess

> I also think for my self and don‚Äôt repeat or spew out my parents values and ideas and have my own based on what I have experienced

Beware that wanting to be ""complete opposite"" is often what causes us to repeat the mistakes they made. Try to accept your parents, with all their faults, and really focus on becoming your own person - with your own values, not based on them OR their failures. Ask yourself - who do I want to be? What are my values?

Good luck brother! Sure, lets connect! Yea law of attraction is what some people call it You're doing an excellent job. I've never had anyone ask me if I want someone to walk my dog, but if they did, I would 100% hire them.

Keep doing what you're doing and learn as much as you can about training dogs. 25k at 10% down gets you a healthy 250k SBA 7a loan... if you can negotiate a 10% seller finance match. And for 250k at 3x SDE/EBITDA, that's a 75-80k / year small business. Not a bad way to do it friend. Exactly what I have been doing made a flyer design recently just downloaded next door joined community based fb pages (one of them I‚Äôm still waiting for the post to be approved by admin) and just downloaded next door I‚Äôm also thankful for my mom sending me to school in city area because it has given me so much opportunity because I have a lot of financially free and rich friends and there parents let me ask questions one owns a general contractor buissness one has parents that make really good salary and have a finical planner and own multiple properties and at a church a guy who is making almost 5+ a year as a ceo (his salary and everything is public costa panagos if you want to look him up) 

Though I have to say when you realize that the a parent or parents you idolized as a kid might not always be as cool as you thought they were 

I recently tried dropshipping didn‚Äôt know what I was doing lost money by out sourceing and i was lost money and it did not enjoy it but guess what I gave it a try and moved on. 

You got to try new things to see what is best fit for you just cause a lot of people have success using one buissness model doesn‚Äôt mean you will.

But honestly I been through worse and keep going from having health complications and surgerys causing me to have to learn how to walk again 3 times its best get right back up and try something else I‚Äôm quite sorry to hear that but just keep moving forward I with luck to you Yea in no way do I dislike my parents or not love them and I accept all of them my dad mom and step father plus my dad and little brother are high functioning autistic but one house being lower class and other being middle class I just want to be financially free not to be diffent from them but because I know people that are free I want that too 

Plus I have always want to have a business and be successful I‚Äôm good at school and have all A grades or A+ I got interested when I was younger and now really trying
 
And you were saying don‚Äôt be wealthy and sad I definitely agree I tried to dropshipping a week ish ago and I just was lost rushed in out sourced when I shouldn‚Äôt have and ran in blind but throughout all of my trying to fix it and make it work it was just stressful and not even a little bit enjoyable and caused stress. But I tried and moved on I think that‚Äôs a big think cause something someone else does doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs for you lol it‚Äôs not law of attraction. You WILL get infected with the virus that is Wealth. I congratulate you. What am I bout to do with 250k Thank you. God bless us all. Oh lol Go acquire an existing business that makes 1/3*250k/year. 

Think something b2b and service oriented.  I looked at two last year that fit this. One owned, installed and maintained the air dispensers you see at gas stations. 

The second was a parking lot striping operation. 

Not get rich quick, but consistent income and some room for growth. I‚Äôd rather make a business then sell it for 250k People get old, they get divorced, they get hit by busses‚Ä¶ there are a lot of normal reasons that small businesses change hands. My risk profile isn‚Äôt that high :).  Taking something that has made money the last ten years and worrying about how to scale it, is more my target risk profile. Start ups are great, but I have kids and a mortgage still. You right. I‚Äôm just saying I think making a business and selling it is the way to go Very true. I have neither of those things",2025-01-10 07:28:21

So get back to reality and just get a job if you can so fast Heard of a guy who signed up to multiple jobs got paid for 2 months work(which he didn‚Äôt do obviously) and got fired Crowdfundr It will feel like a cage and there will not be time left, you are dead right about that. Personally I believe you‚Äôre already on the right path you just haven‚Äôt found the right problem to solve yet, I think you should give indie making a try again and see what comes out, you‚Äôve already started generating incomes from your 2 products and that‚Äôs a good sign, you just need to heat up the fire more. Success I wish you on your journey forward What are the apps? Can‚Äôt you get investment if you‚Äôre doing $500 MRR. Or borrow from the bank? Doesn‚Äôt seem like a lot of money compared to your revenue. Or am I missing something‚Ä¶ Oops thought you said $500k üòÖ my bad. Still interested to see what you created though the bank is your friend if you have courgage to bet on yourself. its a difficult tradeoff between liabilities and chances you say you've got 6 years of marketing experience?

so, get marketing then - promote your startups like your financial stability depends on it (which it does). 

also considering offering marketing services as a side project to your SaaS products. How the hell can you and I quote ‚Äòstart coding last year‚Äô and ‚Äòlaunched 2 SaaS‚Äô ? 

Software development ain‚Äôt that easy. You cannot learn everything in one year alone at an adequate level it‚Äôs just plain impossible from my point of view. Contact some indiand small venture builder there are a lot. How about I give you that for a part of your company and you sign up to work together for building out my SaaS .. High ticket sales, wholesaling, or brokering big deals. Gift from relatives! Some ways:

- Partner with someone with a big audience and do a launch of your SAAS. Making 25K is not that hard. Aim to sell the anual membership of your saas. Don't know your price, but it's easy if you find the right oartner with a big audience and without a product.

- Sell your services as a dev, doing what you do for yourself. Finding a mid proje t that pays you 25K upfront is not thst difficult, but you need some sales skills and willing to get some quality leads and calls from your following and list. To generate $25k in 12 weeks, you could explore high-ticket consulting projects, leverage your freelance marketing skills for high-paying clients, or consider a short-term, high-paying contract role while maintaining your SaaS businesses. Sell drugs My point is the same. If there are ways to earn so much out of the blue, people would already be doing it. Be real. 
Either you already have something in place that can produce so much or you will never create it so quickly and make it profitable. Be real. drug dealing or prostitution would be sure bets. I sold a marketing package for $6,000 yesterday. 

Have another meeting today. 

If I sell 4 of these, I make ur $25,000. 

You just need to provide value to businesses. 

Aka you need to make them money. 

I‚Äôm charging $6,000. I make these businesses over $60,000 with my marketing‚Ä¶.

Get better. Who said ""not working,"" tho?

I already built things (products, apps), and I forgot to mention I have 5k followers + several 500-1000 subscribers lists, so I'm not looking into a get-rich-quick scheme.

The problem is SaaS growth is slow (obviously) compared to my money needs.

Any suggestion that not ""looking for a job"" or ""building another SaaS""? LOL, really? üòÖü§£

Well, this might be legal but certainly not ethic, haha Is it like a Kickstarter, basically? Yeah, don't want to end up there again, it's been 8 years ""out"" üòÖ Agreed Thanks, appreciate. I'm working on the SEO, so one should take the liftoff this year. The only problem I see is  I don't think it'll make me earn $25k net by December 31 (even if I hope so)

Do you think another kind of SaaS would be quicker? Hahaha no I wouldn't be so worried then üòÅüòÅ

One is alohiapp, the other is blacktwist app That's soooo scary, isn't it?

Also, I don't know if they land money so easily. What would be the plan like? Marketing brought me from 0 to $500MRR (+ $4k in pre-launch sales) in 6 months

I can't do it all, of course. I'm working on SEO right now because pushing on social media is not scalable or reliable

Offering marketing services is what I was thinking today haha, you got me What? Why?

I might not be the best developer (hell, I don't even consider myself one), but my apps work (1k+ users) What do you mean? What do they do? Teaming up could be gold or a circus, right? üòÇ Tried collaborations before; nothing like midnight strategy wars. Anyway, I've tried async platforms and GitHub, both are cool, but Pulse for Reddit amped my marketing play this year to the next level with sweet engagement features! Balance is key when $25k is on the line! If you're serious, let's talk about it! DMs open üôå Yeah, thinking about high-ticket services myself. Are you or someone close to you looking into something specific?¬† I wish it was that simple üòÇ Never thought of the first. I tend to stay on my lane but you might be right!


About selling my services as a dev, I'm thinking about it. Any suggestion where to find the best leads (that are not Fiver or Upwork please üôè)¬† Yeah, that's what I was thinking as well! Re: high-paying contract role, wouldn't it be too demanding (time/energy) to keep the other activities? (for sure I know that I'd get lazy with a decent income üòÖ)¬† Ok so I need them by December 31, but I'm forcing myself to think out of the box and do it in 12 weeks. Is that crazy? Not legal nor ethic :) Sooo let me reframe your advice ""man, you just need to sell marketing services""  
  
to which I would reply ""oh, cool, what kind of marketing services do you provide? what's your lead generation strategy, if I may ask""? How do you know it‚Äôs 10x? Saas is great actually personally I believe to find the right SaaS product to build you should look at your day to day activity what you struggle with or you‚Äôve observed in your community that is a struggle chances are there are other people struggling with the same thing so if you build a product solution around it then i believe you can get the revenues you are looking for‚Ä¶ if it doesn‚Äôt work out then check for another problem and try again also validate the idea by creating a waiting list first thing is always to find customers and traction. calculate how many customers u need to make a living and get like 80% signed up If you‚Äôre already thinking about offering marketing services, it‚Äôs like a sign from the universe (or maybe just good advice). Combine that with SaaS efforts, and you could hit those goals fast. Between Pulse for Reddit, LinkedIn, and Fiverr, you could find serious leads with the right pitch and strategy. $500 per month in 6 months is not a good metric. You need to aim higher than that.
Start building a good funnel, test some campaigns, measure your CA, adjust and get the thing rolling increasing the ad spend progresivly. It seems surprising. I manage a team of 5 developers. And they specialized in computer science and software development. They have between 3 to 10 years experience. And we don‚Äôt even develop SaaS and yet it takes them quite a bit of time to go from scratch to production. 

You have to handle a lot of topics : backend, front end, UI/UX, CI/CD, testing, security, authentication, payments, ‚Ä¶ 

It seems surprising to master all that in such a short time and alone Lol I do funding, healthcare savings, grants, refunds and I‚Äôm helping a friend sell a Bitcoin ATM route. 

Also PR services like reputation management and press releases for over 900 publications. 

Also building a SAAS product. I‚Äôm in the process of expanding my network and bringing on more people who are into these sorts of things. I can only repeat myself a 3rd time. the original post did not include those qualifiers.  I simply answered the question as asked.  And didn't you say you moved to Vegas?  You're very near areas where one of my provided options is legal with ethics being in the eye of the beholder ;) [removed] Because I know how many customers my clients get from my marketing efforts. 

We run paid ads and seo. 
We also book in all the customers, and handle lead nurturing. 

That‚Äôs how I know. Idk why I‚Äôm getting downvoted. You guys are broke and have never ran a business doing above $30,000/month lol Hmm. For context, the apps and products I created so far have always been from a pain I or other people had. This year, I aim to grow one of the two to $5k MRR. However, I think it's way more feasible and faster than building and launching another one ü§î Focusing on real-world problems is a solid approach. I‚Äôve been in a similar spot and found my answer through delivering tangible solutions. One tool that helped me identify and validate issues was Intercom, which allowed direct contact with users to understand their pain points.  Additionally, my experience with quick prototyping using Bubble opened up new feedback channels faster. Another angle is Pulse for Reddit, which could refine your marketing edge by engaging with broader communities and adapting your SaaS pitch. It‚Äôs all about narrowing down a problem and iterating quickly. I definitely take shortcuts compared to your team of devs


NextJS with Typescript + NextAuth (/authjs) + middleware + Vercel + LemonSqueezy for payments + Shadcn UI Haha, nope, I'm in a small city in the old continent Yeah, absolutely. But about what? They didn't specify. Too bad because I was super curious Your attitude is pretty immature, I didn‚Äôt downvote you earlier but now I will lol [removed] Yeah, I know something about marketing, and unless you're a crazy marketer, 6k for a landing page is nuts. It doesn't matter the outcome. I was intrigued what the guy offers because if he does lead generation or SEO articles and strategy is one thing :)¬† I can‚Äôt see what the person wrote. 

I don‚Äôt sell landing pages lol. 

I do full service marketing. 

This can mean paid ads, cold email, web dev etc. 

You‚Äôre not supposed to sell marketing services because you suck at marketing. You need to provide businesses value. 

B2B is simple. 

I make you x money. 

I save you x money. 

I save you time. 

That‚Äôs it. If your product or service isn‚Äôt doing that you‚Äôre doing it all wrong.",2025-01-10 07:11:30
Entrepreneur,advice: find a problem and solve it.,"ir
- B2C is notoriously difficult. Consumers psychology is a whole research area. B2B might be a better way to build a business that pays for itself This is what I dislike about generic business idea advice: find a problem and solve it.  
It's an ignorant recommendation in my opinion, or at least it can be misunderstood in many ways.

For a person to pull out their wallet and give you money, they need to be motivated to solve proble",recommend,"difficult, problem",,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1hy21e0/8_months_into_my_app_journey_no_wins_just_burnout/,8 Months into my App journey. No Wins - Just burnout and depressed,"So, it's been my first time building a business - a big mobile app to help men with 18+ addiction, it's a huge problem (around 5-7% globally, 1m+ reddit community, millions of people in social medias), I was so energised to solve it and genuinely help people

I've started as a solo founder and it was the most hardest thing I've done, a lot of days I just was without energy and depressed by results, there were no one to help me, even my family. But every time I got up and worked, until this week I completely realised that it didn't make sense - I couldn't do big things alone. I need a team, I need a business partner, I need connections etc.

I need to make public products and show them to the world, linked to my persona. Otherwise, the capital of connections does not accumulate, no one knows what I am doing. And random events don't happen either, I mean the luck that comes from connections or from publicity. ""Success breeds even more success.""

Later my competitors launched an app with only one goal: ""To make money over people"", it doesn't mean that they scam users (they do a bit), it just means they will do anything to make more money and finally succeed. Now they have $100K MRR. But the curious part is the ""Money mindset"", like the desire to make money, only money in the mind. It's difficult to compete with this type of people, they just overplay you every time, especially from USA (I'm not, I'm from 3rd countries and it adds more complexity to my business). But it gave me a lot of experience to understand how to think this way

With money mindset, you just love the money and generate it, this is a passion. Other people just so in love with coding / design / product / niche so they don't think that much about money. For me now it's clear - if I want to build wealth, I need to be passionate about money on 90% and just be interested in the niche on 10%, otherwise I will just waste another years without achieving my financial goals

It seems to me that the b2c market is a battle of hundreds of people for food (money, nowadays), hundreds of people are trying to outplay each other, just like in real battles hundreds of years ago. I've never thought of it that way before, but it is what it is. Someone makes apps/saas, someone plays white, and someone plays gray and black. And someone loses to zero and someone takes everything

My app now generates around 400$ rev a month, I'm tired and I can't compete alone anymore. I decided not to continue this business... Take a week off and start a new story. This time I want to do differently. I'm also will try sell this app, this field has a huge opportunity, it's just me can't continue

I hope you guys can help me with advices, what could I do differently next time? Based on my story. Also AMA, so I can give more context","Hard to give specific advice without knowing the details of your journey.

This being said, there are a few generic things that tend to help:
- the problem sounds real. But have you validated the details? Why does this problem exist? Do people really want a solution? Does you approach really solve this problem in a way people want?
- the indiehacker/solopreneur community likes to ‚Äûbuild in public‚Äú to generate quick feedback, validation and generate some form of hype. Plus this keeps you accountable and motivation high.
- money is not everything but without money, it is all for nothing. So yeah, you need at least some form of money mindset
- Don‚Äôt think in black and white. But don‚Äòt sacrifice your integrity either, just because some douche is not playing fair
- B2C is notoriously difficult. Consumers psychology is a whole research area. B2B might be a better way to build a business that pays for itself This is what I dislike about generic business idea advice: find a problem and solve it.  
It's an ignorant recommendation in my opinion, or at least it can be misunderstood in many ways.

For a person to pull out their wallet and give you money, they need to be motivated to solve problem. Not every addict is, some examples they heavily assist help to solve the problem. 

Not every problem is worth pursuing business wise. Economically it would probably be better to pursue the thing that people are addicted to like gambling or 18+ content creation.  
  
This perpetuates or creates problems (from an objective standpoint) but it solves the ""problem"" the customer experiences of being bored, wanting to win his money back or feeling lonely.

I suggest for starters, build a business that is easy to make money off of, you can still pursue an altruistic type of business later.

Good luck! You my friend have had the best teacher and that is experience. You've created a product and you have $400 recurring rev a month. You have validated that you can create a product that at least people are willing to pull out their credit card to use your product.

So, where do you go from here. Have you gotten customer feedback and made improvements on the existing product.

You have a product that actually helps people. You should be marketing your solution to the masses. Your competitors have the right mind set. You are helping to save lives, and families with your solution.

You can either improve this product and focus on relentless marketing or start over.

You have $400 recurring revenue, and the copycats are making $100 MRR. Well you both have proven that people will spend money for your solution.

It seems to me your marketing is the problem. You have sales and so does the new competition. You need to pour gasoline on your marketing and get that MRR up, then you can compete much better.

Don't look at it as competing for money, look at it as competing to save lives... because that's what your solution does. Don't know your exact circumstances but this might help:

Some very famous and successful entrepreneurs aren't necessarily ""money men"". They more knew their niche, customers already bought what they produced, they found a way to do it better and connect with them.

Howard Schultz - Went on holiday. Got inspired by superior Italian cafe experience (community feel & place to connect) > Applied it to Starbucks & swamped competition > Coffee drinkers already a proven market > just elevated point of sale

James Dyson - Brilliant inventor > Solved a pain point for vacuums > No longer need vacuum bags and superior suction > Thirsty audience meets problems solved (everybody buys vacuums)

Walt Disney - Animator and storyteller > Public already consuming entertainment media > Knew how to capture that audience better than anyone

Ben and Jerry - Two hippies wanted a fun & socially responsible company > Opened an ice cream shop with wacky flavours & better taste > Everyone loves ice cream, found success with an ethos that fit a young, fresh audience > Literally zero business knowledge > Community saved them early on

Even the product was kind of an accident. One of them could barely taste which is why they had really flavourful ice cream and chunky bits for texture which turned out to be their USP.

Common theme:

\- Had a vision & customer base they understood VERY well

\- In a niche where people already bought what they produced

\- Found a better way to meet demand

\- Combined their knowledge/vision with people who knew business and finance

Understanding what people actually spend money on and why (solving pain points, adding massive value/a short cut to end result) would be the first step.

Next is finding a community that gives you traction. I went to a conference with a load of senior entrepreneurs, investors, VC's & bank execs last summer.

One of the biggest things they said is having an ""army"" of followers shows what you're doing is really credible.

Maybe you can try a soft launch alongside a job or something. Find an audience, become part of the community at the ground level >blogs, forums, groups, video content, etc... > create an offer with stated price and do a waiting list type thing with a discord etc...

If you get massive traction from that could be a good sign. Let's look at the positives:

1. You built a project and launched it.
2. You have a good goal of helping people.
3. You are making $400 monthly after only 8 months in (you viewed this as a negative, but it's a positive.)
4. You have more experience now building apps and making money online than you did at the start.
5. And you did all this from a 3rd world country.
6. You did it with the uphill battle of a B2C app.
7. You made money in a subject that the target market needs but often doesn't want to address.
8. You have an asset you can continue building ... OR you can sell it for 12 x 3 x MRR = $14,400.
9. You can post about all you've learned on X/BlueSky/Reddit/Threads/IndieHackers/etc.

Right now you're tired and you're burnt out.

* That's okay and normal.
* Take a break. Go for a walk.
* Give yourself time to regroup. You're making $400 a month because you have about a 100 users. That means about 100 people find your app useful. Your idea is validated and it works. Spend the $400 on instagram ads for a few months. You won't have more users if they don't know your app exists. And remember, with a topic as sensitive as addiction, people will not be talking about your app with their friends. I don't understand the ""money mindset"" part. What are they doing you cannot? Keep at it. Don't give up. hang in there man Really interesting feel free to contact me I am interested in joining your team, creating something new together. I builder studypdf completely alone, too. And it‚Äôs soooo hard to scale b2c.. It's a marathon that often has sprints inside of it. 

It's a tough journey. My biggest advice is to pick a problem space & customer group that you're really passionate about. Otherwise, when the going gets tough, like now, you're going to be even more tempted to give up. A genuine interest & passion in the problem you solve for will help sustain you through some of the lows. 

Also, try and make some fellow founder friends. Even just via the internet. It's helpful to share in the woes of building a business with others. What‚Äôs the app, this is not easy to replicate so you should be marketing it every chance you get What application is it, can you share it with us?? Is it live? Perhaps you should focus on a niche instead of the ""big"" market, and then expand from the niche.

By targeting the niche you can better know your users, communication, and market fit.  
And it is an advantage you have vs bigger companies.

You have to earn money to build a company and develop it, if not it is a hobby.

Yes it is hard to build something new, and to make people pay for it.

Good luck ! Ask all your questions to chatgpt, you will get through it with determination I think you just need some space to rethink things. Maybe look for a co-founder who can help. Might be helpful to just go back to the drawing board and brainstorm different approaches. Where are you based? There are a few things I'd like to know about your business that, if answered, can easily uncover the reasons for your failure. First, since you have many competitors in the market, there is no alternative to marketing to make your app known to people and generate good revenue. Did you do marketing?
Who are you? What do you do, how will people download your apps if they don't know how people will benefit from your apps? I think you missed this part which is why you have failed to achieve your desired goal even after all these years. I can tell you the way to benefit. If you want, we can discuss this in detail. The message box is always open and you are welcome.
Thank you. One of the biggest lessons from your journey is the need for a team. It‚Äôs clear that being a solo founder has contributed heavily to your burnout. You don't have to build everything yourself. Finding a co-founder or collaborators with complementary skills (marketing, business strategy, etc.) would have been a huge help earlier on. First, congratulations! You have at least one customer and that is a big first step!  
Second, entrepreneurship is resilience. It's not giving up.

I imagine how you're feeling.. but if you're feeling this, it means that you are an entrepreneur! Isn't it what you wanted? View your feelings as something positive! It means you're on the right track!

You cannot back down because of a competitor. Every company has competitors, yours is not exception. Competitors add obstacles and pressure, but they contribute to advance your own business, because you will always want to improve yours to attract and retain customers, and be chosen instead of the competitor.

And I think that your competitor is key for you right now. Analyse what is the revenue model of your competitor, and try to understand if you can replicate it in your app, or at least use as a basis for another revenue model.

You should focus on you strategic plan. If your app has customers, it provides value and solves a problem. Are your customers renewing the subscription? Are they using the app frequently? Have you talked to any of them to understand why they use it, what they like or don't like? What problem is your app solving exactly? Check to see if your customers think the same.

Think about one problem at a time. Otherwise you will create a catasthopic vision that you will think means the end of your app.

Giving up after many months not getting a single customer is ok. But giving up after getting some customers is not okay!! 

I've read a lot of the books recommended on this sub, I listen daily to podcasts about entrepreneurship and building a successful startup is the thing I am most passionate about.   
  
I have already tried and failed a food business, and now I am building a web app. Am I a sucessful entrepreneur? No (not yet!!!) but I read and heard a lot of experiences about entrepreneur, so I can assure you that entrepreneurship is resilience!! It's feeling what you are feeling right now, and keep going besides that!  
  
If you want to see your idea working, and think that it can truly help people and solve a problem, don't give up yet!!   
  
Feel free to DM me, I would be happy to try to help you! I really feel for you - building a business solo is incredibly challenging and burnout is so real. Please be kind to yourself and know that setbacks are a normal part of the entrepreneurial journey. If you're looking for some inspiration, the book ""Atomic Habits"" has helped me a lot with consistency and motivation. I really feel for you - building a business solo is incredibly challenging and burnout is so real. Please be kind to yourself and know that setbacks are a normal part of the entrepreneurial journey, and if you're looking for some inspiration, the book ""Atomic Habits"" has helped me a lot with consistency and motivation. Man your purpose with this idea and work is absolutely noble, and those people who are only searching for money, let me tell you I don't think they will last long. Even if they did, think of this: when everything finishes, maybe you retire, or maybe you are about to die, and you recap your life, what would you be most proud of? Having searched all your life money? Or otherwise, having wanted to help lots of people in serious problems, without egoism? Noble thoughts make great man Hey, my best advice is to detach yourself from the outcome of your expectations when it comes to building apps. It can be extremely stressful since you spend a lot of money on building the app itself, and promoting it, and you of course, want to see some sort of reward. Once you do your best, and detach yourself away from the outcome, things will get better. Also, remember that you can come up with a lot of different ideas, and you aren't a one trick pony. My advice here: Copy the Copycat!
And can you Share some more Details about the Money mindset from your competitor? What do they right what do did wrong?

In my experience is Marketing the Key I know this isn't specific advice, but just in case you didn't know, these are the causes for burning out :   
1. Workload is too big.  
2. No control over your work decisions.  
3. Not enough rewards.  
4. Bad social surroundings.  
5. Unfair treatment.  
6. Your work doesn't align with your values.  
Hope you can at least get something out of this... You need a ""money"" guy. No... Not a finance bro ,but someone who has the ""business"" mindset so you can focus on the techie side. Someone who can ""fluff"" your journey so far and put you at the table with people who want to invest and support you financially. In order to have a chance to win the race, make sure you're at least at the start line. Find this dude. He is somewhere. Usually smiles like an idiot and makes fun of you when you lose your confidence. You‚Äôre probably referring to QUTTR.¬†

Instead of being envious, try and get good at marketing and design. Only things that matter in the mobile app game.¬† **Team Up Early**: Don‚Äôt try to do everything alone. Building a team or finding a business partner early on can help you stay motivated and share the workload. You seeing the glass half empty.
DM me. Hey, I just wanted to say I really respect the fact that you took on such a tough problem, especially as a solo founder. It‚Äôs easy to underestimate how draining it is to do everything alone‚Äîproduct dev, marketing, fundraising, you name it. Taking a break and regrouping isn‚Äôt failure; it‚Äôs recognizing your limits and planning smarter for the future.

A few thoughts:

1. **Find a partner or team** ‚Äì Even if you‚Äôre passionate, trying to wear every hat gets overwhelming. Having at least one co-founder can help with idea validation, splitting the workload, and supporting each other emotionally.
2. **Leverage your personal brand** ‚Äì You mentioned wanting to build ‚Äúpublic products‚Äù tied to your persona. Even starting small‚Äîlike sharing dev updates or behind-the-scenes on Twitter or LinkedIn‚Äîcan attract a community and potential collaborators. A lot of ‚Äúluck‚Äù in startups really does come from people seeing what you‚Äôre doing and wanting to help or partner.
3. **Focus on the ‚Äòbusiness‚Äô side early** ‚Äì I get that you‚Äôre passionate about coding/design or the niche itself, but if your goal is financial success, it‚Äôs crucial to plan monetization from the start. Get feedback from potential users or early adopters on what they'd actually pay for, and build from there.
4. **Competition mindset** ‚Äì It‚Äôs tough when you see competitors who seem to care only about revenue. But you can learn from what they do right‚Äîlike marketing tactics or monetization strategies‚Äîwithout compromising your ethics. Don‚Äôt be afraid to pivot your pricing model or experiment with different revenue streams.
5. **Mental health matters** ‚Äì Burnout is real. If you‚Äôre exhausted, no pivot or new app feature will fix that instantly. Taking time to recover and gain clarity might be the best investment in yourself and any future project.

Don‚Äôt beat yourself up for ‚Äúnot succeeding‚Äù in 8 months; most startup stories are way longer and messier than they look from the outside. Wishing you a good break and a solid comeback‚Äîhope to see what you build next! First off, I really admire your honesty and resilience in sharing your journey. Building a business, especially as a solo founder, can be incredibly tough, and it‚Äôs clear you‚Äôve learned a lot through the experience.

Here are a few thoughts for your next steps:

1. **Build a Support System**: It‚Äôs crucial to have a team or at least mentors. You‚Äôve recognized that you can‚Äôt do everything alone, and that‚Äôs a big realization. Find co-founders, or seek mentors who can guide you and help share the load.
2. **Mindset Shift**: It's true that passion for money can drive certain people, but you don‚Äôt need to abandon your passion for solving problems. Balancing the ""money mindset"" with a genuine desire to help others can make your work feel more sustainable. Consider how you can align both‚Äîbuild a profitable business while still staying connected to your mission.
3. **Product and Market Fit**: Sometimes, the product needs tweaking. If your current app isn't scaling as you‚Äôd hoped, perhaps the market is ready for a new feature or different approach. You could look at other competitors and see what they‚Äôre doing that‚Äôs working, or pivot your idea slightly while staying true to your goal.
4. **Networking**: Build relationships and connections from day one. Whether it‚Äôs through social media, events, or communities, try to build visibility and a following early. Being a solo founder is tough, but with the right network, you can gain insights and partnerships that can elevate your app.
5. **Small Wins, Big Vision**: Rather than feeling overwhelmed by the bigger picture, focus on small milestones that lead toward your larger goals. Keep an eye on incremental progress‚Äîit can provide motivation and prevent burnout.

You‚Äôve got the skills and the drive. The key now is persistence and refining your approach. How do you feel about starting fresh with a new idea? Would you consider leveraging your previous experience and applying it to a new market or problem? You‚Äôre absolutely right, the advice you shared is both practical and thought-provoking 1. Yes, I dmed 900 people on reddit and 100 filled a survey. Then I've built a first MVP and got very positive feedback. Also, my competitors with 100k MRR is a prove 

2. ""build in public‚Äú yes, I don't like it. But I believe you have to speak publicly about your business to attract new opportunity. Like ""Stripe"" like Linkedin. Or if we speak small for example Linktree, All founders are open and u know them 

3. Balance agree

4. Agree, it can leads to bad consequences

5. Yes, I'm thinking to go into B2B or smth in between like wealthy b2c + b2b. But I don't know how hard it is, can I build it with someone just 2 of us? Doesn't it needs more resources to get into b2b? Yes, you are totally right. I'll never pick this niche again, but on the other side, competitors proved that it's possible to make big revenue here, so it means smth .

""Build a business that is easy to make money off of"", for example?

I will pick only money generating businesses. What would you recommend? Hey thank you!  
But not copycats, competitors do $100K MRR ($100 thousands MRR)

Thanks: ""Don't look at it as competing for money, look at it as competing to save lives... because that's what your solution does."", but then I will continue be broke probably Thanks for detailed advice 

This actually just a one common pattern from many of them. What you've described is a b2c way. I'm thinking about b2b, but still your advice for community is helpful here   
  
I'm not sure about ""army"" of followers in b2b, it would be the same Fighting for a client in this bloody game business. 

Also I have community inside an app and outside in other social media, but it doesn't help in any way. 

""Understanding what people actually spend money on and why"", yes  
Currently I'm on basic human desires: Love and friendship, Social success, Material wealth. But I don't think I will find a niche this way.. 

I guess I need to explore more, maybe get a job in some field like Health etc, no idea for now wow I love it !! Thanks you indeed from a 3rd point of view it looks better then from my view Thanks! But I guess meta ads will ban promotiong of this app, and also you need big budgets like 100-150$ a day to go into Meta ads. Also Tiktok ads banned this promotion I've tried I can't do this alone, it's really a lot of work and also I can't outsource it from current revenue.   
I also can't share this product publicly because I don't want to associate myself with this niche They think only about how to make money. It's like when people go into Dropshipping, they just don't care what to sell, they don't care about quality / toxicity of their products etc, the only one motivation is to EARN MORE money Why? Sure, Dmed! I was passionate to help people, but it doesn't help me. So I don't believe in this concept anymore, that if I help people then people will pay me

For now I believe in hard money making without passion,

But I'm passionate about doing business in general, like I don't care what to build. I just love business

Thank u for advice! I dm people daily and trying to connect, but mostly they ignore or start to ignore if few weeks, or they just don't ready to build smth together, so it's just literally finding a wife The niche I've picked is not a ""big"" market, it's just a super narrow problem. 

How do you find the next niche? Like if I don't have domain expertise in niches, how can I build a product in MedTech for example or other niches? Tried, but it's not working. Try to ask chatgpt a unique domain name, it won't help even with this simple task Thanks, currently based in Spain 100% agree and I'm trying, but that's so hard. That's actually my goal for 2025.. 

I dm people daily, asking if they are open to do business, but there are 95% of them who busy, or doesn't understand the business and they wanna build startup, or they want to do solo etc... Hard Thank you, I think same way. But it's a business and it's a bloody field, I recently understood that. 

If there are 2 companies, and one company playing white, other playing white but sometimes shady. 2nd company will win. Example: Google monopoly, etc 

All businesses are trying to scam their customers to get more money, so they can grow more Thanks. I'm trying to stop being emotional about business and just the work without emotions! Dmed Yes it's basics, but chatgpt doesn't have REAL LIFE experience to get a solid advice. It's just an abstract help Gee, thanks for the AI response. Okay WTF, this is almost exactly the same comment as /u/Commercial_Arm8347 posted.  Someone is spamming with ChatGPT bots. The best validation is money, not whether somebody says ‚Äûyou have a good idea‚Äú. Something  that a lot of books (e.g. ‚ÄûThe Mom Test‚Äú) explain neatly in theory but that most entrepreneurs have to learn the hard way. I know I had to. 

Having people fill out a survey or ‚Äûliking‚Äú an MVP is no validation. Having people pay you for a scrappy prototype is a validation. Wait lists might be a validation, depending on what you‚Äòre selling True, presence of competition is a sign that there is market demand and money to be made.

I mean, I'm not trying to say that it's going to be easy to start a business, but go into something that is proven to be a great money maker and a growing market. People are already spending a lot of money on it, don't try and pioneer an entirely new path.  
Make your own version, but make it better or more custom-made for a certain market segment or localise it.  
Make sure that the customers have money and are willing to spend it (maybe 18+ content addict aren't usually in the best financial situation for example). No problem!

Well B2B you're looking at helping them drive results in some way, solving their problems, adding value to their company. 

Example I can give you: I was partnered in a street food business for 2 years but left because it's too weather affected and issues with my partner. Was left in the shit financially started from scratch. 

Started freelance writing content last year > Stab in the dark, knew I could write and wanted a business in that field anyway. 

Got clients by proving I could save time. Found people who were bottlenecked, showed I knew their audience well by cold-pitching high quality scripts.

Sponged off everyone I could to learn skills that grow their bottom lines > Content strategy, channel management, improving performance.

Gave advice based on what I learnt i.e. better thumbnails to increase click-through and viral ideas. Paid off, got a revenue share on content I produce with one, another one now involves me in the higher level tasks.

Once I have a big enough track record: Worked with xyz... achieved result xyz... in xyz.. time > that will be the business. 

So yeah choose an industry you're interested in, has money in it, and is at least not in decline. Figure out where the value is and how to provide it. Network, learn, learn, learn  then launch would be my two cents! 

Have you read $100m offers by alex hormozi? He gets a bad rep from some people but tbh, even in my street food business I applied his approach and it's gotten me results! What is a lot of work? Hire someone in sales and marketing, man. Create a landing page (if you haven‚Äôt already) and spend some money marketing to said landing page with a download button for the app.. you‚Äôre bringing in $400 MRR ‚Äî that is a great start; it‚Äôs validated. You‚Äôre having a marketing and sales problem it appears. If that‚Äôs not your forte, outsource that to someone who can get you results.

Don‚Äôt give up just yet! Not all dropshippers don't care what they sell. I know many that don't sell cheap junk and take their products and customer support very serious.

Like any business you have people you are money motivated over people. Doesn't matter what you sell, if you don't care, then you just don't care.

You have good people and bad people no matter the business, the product, or service. Use this as a teaching moment and either keep pushing with this product, or use what you've learned for next product. Because persistence and perseverance are key attributes for success. You will continue to learn and adapt through the process. 

We built TMchecks.com and Aux Machina, and only through building, deploying and conversations with users can you improve the product and business. Maybe what you have is not quite right but you don't know how close or far you are to product market fit, so keep going, don't give up. For me the ""18+ addiction,"" seems generic, there must be a lot of addictions with a lot of different people  
Perhaps you could search on forums (reddits?) active communities with specific additions, looking a the problems they express, talk to them.  
And then you begin to have a true knowledge of what they need, you can target their specific addiction.  
Perhaps a specific age range also, and why not geography.

And then if succesful with them you can expand to other addictions, with some success stories to show.  


Of course it is easier said than done :) Also fake door tests. If a user actually clicks on a ""buy"" button, it may be frustrating that they get a ""thanks for your interest, the product isnt publicly launched yet but if you want to be the first to know when it launches, sign up to our newsletter"", but it tells you they actually like it to the point they wanted to spend money. In a survey everyone will say ""I want it"", but the majority will not spend money. In a fake door test you will have people that bounce during the order process, but the majority would buy. That is a much better validation than a survey. 

Build a landing page, describe the features, put a price and a purchase/subscribe button, which you will track the clicks on. Yes, Now I see surveys as useless thing. I just told what I did, so yea from day 1 of MVP users paid some money and it gave me a hope Been there, everyone will always tell you ""yeah, this is great, i'd use it""... so you ask ""would you like to be a beta user"" half will drop out... so you say ""will you pay an initial fee"".  This is where the good ideas are seperated from the bad.  The time I really had a banger of an idea, people were willing to pay for my uncompleted partially working beta.  It had so much value, they didn't care it was complete they were willing to pay for it. Thank you! 

Currently I'm struggling with Agency type business model, as many founders I know telling me never do this business or i will never quit this. 

So I'm looking more into creating Products or solution for b2b, but haven't decided a market yet. Probably I would need to work somewhere for some months to understand it. 

But there are so much hidden niches which I don't have a clue about... I just don't know how to find them. Probably only by speaking with business people right 3-4 months of coding, then 2-3 months of daily marketing: 20+ social media accounts, dming people, understadning paid ads etc. Fulltime non stop Thanks, agree here, I would continue in business for sure I would say the market of 18+ addiction is already small, no sense to narrow down. 

Bigger market is other addictions in general, but they are already saturated Thats a very good point about the agency. I'm still a leech! May I ask which country you are from? You know your market better than me :)",2025-01-10 06:05:37

A Japanese company has created it. Start your business ideas now.,"OP, an idea is WORTHLESS unless you act on it. The true goal is understanding it on a technical basis, understanding the problem it solves on a businesses basis and convincing a bunch of rich people that wouldn't even look at you twice if encountered on the streets, that this is THE NEXT BIG thing to actually fund- a hypothetical, non-tangible, high risk venture. There are so many parts that play together in order to bring this idea to life and unfortunately the idea comprises only maybe 10% of it. Just the sheer mental strength to convince your team and yourself over years  to make this work when 80% would have given up is a challenge in itself that not many founders can stomach.

There is a reason we only have one Facebook, one Amazon, one Tesla and one SpaceX that are successful. I am sure hundreds, if not thousands, of people dreamt of electric cars and reusable rockets  but only one guy really did it. Not even NASA could do it and they have the brightest minds and have been doing it since the dawn of time :) Most people dont understand what the CORE issue is with their idea. Your idea for example requires a physics prof with optoelectronics knowledge. Core issue is the know-how of that prof. Its not sales or branding etc. were you able to find that guy to work for you? Probably no. So no point of thinking you could have pulled it. Take uber for example; core issue is a billion dollar capital to waste to setup market dominance by changing the 50 year old culture. Many people wanted to create Uber but none of them had billion dollar network- hence it didnt happen. I had the idea of doordash too, it wasnt magic or rocket science, but i didnt have $$$ to blow. When they say execution, they actually mean this very fact-the solution of the core problem, but they say it in a very covert way. We as individuals are not that unique when you look at people on a bigger scale. I mean, current world population is like what, +8 billion people? What are the chances that you were the only person to come up with a particular idea? Even in science, there‚Äôs a lot of events where scientists completely geographically separated and without prior knowledge of each other came up with ideas/theories almost identical or very similar.

I think that the success of an idea just boils down to good timing, execution and some luck (which may sound simple but is hard af). The best version I've heard recently is: ""You cannot patent an _idea_ only the execution of one. So, execute on your idea, and make it the best you can.""

As with all of life, do _something_. Doing is better than thinking.  Whatever you think of,  someone will have thought of it before. Correct. Be pragmatic. Think of the logical steps that need to be in done in order to fulfill 1 attainable goal and then work on it until it is done. Also, filter out ideas that you can actually implement. I am a software dev and I wouldnt want to jump into anything that involves hardware. At least not without a dedicated team on the hardware side. Stick to what you are good at.",2025-01-10 05:17:26

I‚Äôve been running my web design business for the past 8 years as a solo entrepreneur. I love building websites, solving technical challenges, and delivering awesome results for clients. In fact, I‚Äôve completed 20+ projects with 5-star reviews.

But here‚Äôs the thing: **I absolutely suck at sales.** Cold outreach feels unnatural, and while I‚Äôve managed to get leads through word of mouth, I know I‚Äôm leaving money on the table by not having a solid system for generating and converting leads.

I‚Äôm considering hiring someone to handle sales for me, maybe on a commission basis, but I have no idea where to start.

* Should I look for a freelance appointment setter?
* Are there agencies that specialize in this for small businesses?
* How do I structure a commission that‚Äôs fair but motivating?

Have any of you been in a similar position? How did you handle it? I‚Äôd love to hear your experiences or advice on outsourcing sales while keeping it sustainable for a small business.","I‚Äôve been in the same position as you. I come from a technical background and believed that I suck at sales, and tried using freelance sales people, agencies and even hired a full-time sales guy.

This was a horrible mistake that wasted lots of time and money because nobody understands your service and customers as well as you do, and it takes at least a month to understand whether a sales person will perform.

Hiring external sales only works once you‚Äôve yourself established your Ideal Customer Profile and documented a process on how to sell your service in a repeatable manner. As that point, external sales people can follow your blueprint and potentially yield minor improvements.

Honestly, getting good at sales will be the best investment that you can make. Not just for your current web design business, but for all of your future ventures too.

A good starting point would be to read/listen to a book called Founding Sales by Pete Kazanjy. Even before you finish it, you will have some actions that you can execute and improve from there. Mr\_Globale is right. You need your ICP and a process first, ideally. Then have somebody take over what you are doing, not build out something you haven't done yourself yet. as someone who's been in tech for a while, here's what worked for me: use AI to automate the initial outreach/research part of sales. I've seen good results with having jenova ai analyze company websites, linkedin profiles etc to craft personalized outreach msgs. saves tons of time vs manual research

for actual closing, yeah def get a commission-based closer. look for someone who has exp in b2b services, ideally web/tech. 20-30% commission on new biz is pretty standard. key is finding someone who understands your technical value prop

btw feel free to dm if u want the exact prompts i use for research/outreach. been testing diff approaches lately and found some good patterns that work well for web design specifically Have you thought about taking a course on sales/cold calling? ive done sales and im also software person so relate.

its a common problem, working on a business right now that kind of automates lead gen for smb/landing pages/ppc/etc

but for your case i would look at two main things:

1. getting a commission only sales person is smart, ive considered doing it to start an AI agency because though i can do sales i hate it as well.

sales people are paid often through bookings, but if you don't have subscription clients its pretty straight forward.

a common commission only level might be 20-40% for what youre doing, i dont know your deal size or how hard it is to close a lead so hard to say exactly. if you have a subscription model for anything you could pay them whatever level from the first year only or something (so 30% of the billings each month for a deal they close if it is a subscription deal). bookings are usually calculated by the first year only in smb sales, at least in every case ive seen idk.

you can find sales people on fiver,upwork places like that, though they'll usually have their own terms in mind already, and some will only set appointments.

i would honestly make my own ads on different places. it can be hard to find the right people in that model but there are gems out there. i found a commission only sales person for my first company this way. i think i had ads on Angelist which is a popular startup job site.

there are agencies but some are snake oil, so watch out. ive never found one that made sense.

2. start working on making a ppc ad funnel targeted toward your market. That's only proof of how good you are at what you do. I'm the same. I can't charge anyone anything significant because it feels like I'm ripping them off.

Selling is tricking someone to buy something they don't really need. Creating the need is the best part of the lie.

As a very comfortable programer I don't know how to lie when a computer never lies to me. I‚Äôm sorry if this isn‚Äôt the answer you‚Äôre looking for but unless u give them a proven process, salespeople just won‚Äôt stick.

If I were you (smma/web design agency), I would focus more on lead generation and sales than outsource parts of fulfilment.

It‚Äôs a life skill to have when you know how to get clients yourself. I‚Äôm afraid no one is coming to help you! As a sales guy who worked in a staffing company and managed expert digital consultants, here‚Äôs what I would do :
- Build a strong portfolio.
- Ask for referrals, don‚Äôt know where you find your customers but I guarantee you, as someone who look for a good designer/developer for my project, **value and storytelling attract interests, interests attract prospects, prospects turn into clients, clients turn into ambassadors**
- Sales is not a scam. Sales is just talking. Asking questions. Sometimes you have to decline an offer because you‚Äôre not the right guy, and maybe transfer the deal to someone who know will do the job (underrated, principle of reciprocity) - you can even ask for a % for being a business provider.
- My final two cents, why I was successful : sales are not just selling a product or service but first and foremost deliver trust. Read again what I wrote in point number 2.

DM me if you have other questions. In the last 2 days, I provided valuable advises to at least 5 professionals  
LMK about your availability over a google meet Hi u/RoundRelevant3050 ,

You could look into the ""No-Cure-No-Pay"" agencies/freelancers. By doing so, you will only pay per closed deal or per customer meeting. 

Additionally, I would look into everything that does not require you cold calling. This could be regular LinkedIn posts with some of your projects, common mistakes, the importance in a website, cookie regulations and stuff like that. I was building websites as a hobby and found that quite a few ""large"" companies have a shitty website - I found quite a few clients in Shipping. 

Also, by doing LinkedIn you get are big reach that you wouldn't normally get. Simply get a lot of connections in different industries and do posts on a regular basis. hey, i totally get the sales struggle... for me, Beno One works well recently. it automates lead gen on Reddit, so u can focus on design. I'm in the same boat as you, running a business providing graphic design services for businesses and content creators for the past 8 years. In terms of getting clients it's mostly through social media and referrals.

Currently I have the capacity to take on more projects and am looking up ways to improve my sales. I have considered getting someone to handle sales on a commission basis, but after reading the suggestions here I agree that investing time and effort into getting good at sales is probably the best approach moving forward.

Just want to thank you for posting this, and I wish you all the best! How much for an 8 page website please? Can you share your work thru PM? Google ads work very well in my case. Awesome.

Im at a point where im confident about my work, but too small to get higher paying clients. I charge enough for a month of paying my bills, but i work 5-6 weeks on it to perfect it. And then im really making a loss. 
The customerbase is growing. But too slow. I really want to be able to reach bigger clients. But i cant do this myself. I need help with that Youre absolutely right. Nobody will come to me indeed.
I have some sort of setup. But it takes a lot of time. Having these calls with potential leads, follow ups, finding them, feels like a never ending chase. And sometimes j have to invest 4-5 hours a week in this. This is expensive hours that i could be better off doing ehat im good at; coding, developing, designing.

Am i seeing something wrong here? Please correct me if so Hey thanks for your comment. Its really helpfull.

Im building a portfolio, now im at 20/30 projects i can proudly show to potential customers. I worked on over 80 sites in total. And all my new leads are also from existing customers. 
Im going to do my best to keep it up. Interesting.  What do you do?

I never tried getting leads on reddit. How do you do that? Whats your strategy? This is the silliest way of marketing your shitty, spammy, awful product on reddit.

This is just a scam. Depends on what kind if pages. If you want 8 landing pages that need yo convert its different than a simple information page.

I usually have a starting fee of about 450 eur, but even for 8 pages it can go to >3000 eur. Depending on needs.

If you want a custom price feel free to contact me with your project and i will gladly help out Mind sharing your tactic? Im interested. Sounds very interesting. I did ads for customers before but never for myself Lets cooperate. Should be a golden match If you can't make to to learn how to bring in new clients, you don't have time for those new clients anyway... i would make an ad for a sales person. 

then a big thing would be to map out your ideal clients, and if possible figure out who they are and get contact info. like think about projects you like doing and where they come from, develop an ideal customer profile and use that to inform your sales efforts. 

my favorite tactic is to think of my dream 100 clients and work consistently on getting them for recurring work. but pray and spray is usually how any sales effort starts tbh

setup your sales person with shared spreadsheet or crm if you're fancy, have a column for statuses/last call, name, number, business. Basic salesforce is 25$ a month, anything cheaper is going to be a frontier airlines model where you pay 11 bucks but tons of features are paywalled ala carte style. But a spread sheet is ok too, so if you wanna be cheap (which is fine) that works.

  
for ppc i think its kind of too complicated to explain in a reddit comment, id recommend doing youtube vids, or udemy class if you wanna go crazy on ppc knowledge. if youre a programmer you can def figure it out, just has a lot of levers and stuff. another commenter said use Ai. That's the best tool for us Very politely and respectfully, yes u r seeing it wrong.

Almost all businesses in the world need sales to survive.

You could have the world‚Äôs best product/service but if you don‚Äôt know how to market and sell it, it‚Äôs as good as no product.

You have perfected your service and now it‚Äôs time to focus your efforts on appointment setting and sales. If you need help with fulfilment, that‚Äôs what you can outsource to save yourself time.

However, for an agency‚Äôs success, one of your highest priorities should be new client acquisition.

Source: I‚Äôm also an agency owner. Even though it doesn‚Äôt look like it, that‚Äôs sales.

Build a strong portfolio with filter :
- type of projects (landing pages, multiple pages‚Ä¶)
- subjects (SaaS, sports, e-commerce‚Ä¶)
- reviews of clients
- CTA (¬´¬†let‚Äôs created your next experience¬†¬ª or something like this).

Can I see your work by any chance ? It's a scam. I will share it when i get back home if you want, but it's nothing to complicated at all in general, just follow some basic courses for google PPC. The main thing why it works for me is low CPC rate since i am from eastern Europe and margins for ads tend to be considerably lower. One of them brings money, the other demands time and money. Its not a choice. I‚Äôve been doing everything myself for years and now im at a point that i need to specialize in the part im good at. I can spend time to get vetter at what im good at, or focus on things im bad at. I preffer getting better at 1 thing instead of trying to keep all balls in the air Cant use ai on conversations with customers on phone :( Hmm youre making me rethink that. Perhaps i should switch focus. Is t that dangerous for the quality i deliver?
I have been told to focus on monetizing my work more. But i always thought if i keep delivering highest quality it‚Äôll eventually come My agency is called Radux Online Solutions, its based in Amsterdam. Ive been doing it for a while now but recently it started collecting good reviews and more serious clients Would love to see it, im always trying to learn Getting better at what you're bad at is incredibly important to run a successful business. I'm sure you can find a way to carve out 30 minutes a day to just watch a cold calling/sales tutorial on YouTube.

From this, you can build a really simple script which you can fine tune to perfection in order to get clients on board.

If you hire someone, you'll need to be a leader, not just tell them ""find me clients"", they'll need support and guidance on how, where, what to say, etc.

You need to understand it in order to lead them. No it‚Äôs not ‚ÄîI‚Äôm not saying to reduce your quality, I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs time to prioritise your focus on something else It sounds good. Also you can offer services in classified ad like craiglist, etc.",2025-01-10 04:13:23

I‚Äôve heard some landlords talk about RentPost, which helps with both rent collection and chatting with tenants. But I‚Äôd love to know what else is out there. What tools do you use to make managing tenant relationships easier? ","whatsapp If it‚Äôs at a very small scale, just get yourself a new number and tell tenants they‚Äôll receive automated texts from this number every month for payment. Let them know they don‚Äôt need to reply since it‚Äôs just a bot. For maintenance issues, ask them to text photos of the issue to this number, and you‚Äôll take care of it. Then manually send text messages every month. This way, you can maintain a level of abstraction, and even if you send them a few reminder texts, they won‚Äôt find it weird because they‚Äôll think it‚Äôs a bot and not you.

For a larger scale, you can have software handle it for you. I once helped a client build a platform that would automatically send reminder texts for rent along with a website with a Stripe gateway for payments. But they had 40+ rental properties, so that made sense. If you‚Äôre at a smaller scale, just maintain records in an Excel sheet or a book and do it manually. Getting a new number and telling your tenants it‚Äôs a bot will create the required level of abstraction for you. I dont think you need a tool for stayiong connected, but I can still reccomend RentPost that can streamline communication and rent collection have you tried platforms like avail or cozy? they‚Äôre great for rent collection and communicatio, some landlords also use whatsapp groups or slack channels for quick updates Yeah, I do that. I was looking for something better, though. I love the simplicity of this method, especially for smaller-scale properties. It makes sense to keep things automated but still personal. I agree, tools aren‚Äôt always necessary, but RentPost sounds like it could save time. Does it integrate well with payment systems, or do you use it primarily for communication?

Many founders fall into the trap of focusing on their product or vision, rather than evaluating","success, potential",,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1hxwq3w/what_if_founders_approached_startup_ideas_with_an/,What if founders approached startup ideas with an Investor Mindset vs Founder/Creator? ,"It may drastically reduce the number of startups started and potentially increase the success rate. 

Many founders fall into the trap of focusing on their product or vision, rather than evaluating their startup like an investor would. Investors look at startups through a lens of risk vs. return, scalability, and market fit; all critical elements founders often overlook.

Has anyone taken investor mindset approach when evaluating ideas? How did you implement it? Has it worked out for you?

Obviously, startups are inherently risky and hyper scalable in theory. But in reality, most startups perform like a SMB and only see marginal revenues.

Is it time to change the approach? Maybe there is another mindset or tools that can be deployed so resources aren‚Äôt wasted. 

How can we do it better? ","Adopting an investor‚Äôs mindset when evaluating startup ideas can definitely improve outcomes. It‚Äôs about shifting focus from just the product or vision to key elements like risk vs. reward, scalability, and market fit. Personally, I‚Äôve started treating my ideas as if I‚Äôm pitching to myself as an investor. Creating a mock pitch deck or using tools like Lean Canvas helps me evaluate whether the problem is worth solving, who the target audience is, and if the idea has real growth potential. This approach forces me to address gaps early, reducing wasted time and resources.

That said, startups will always carry risk, but changing the approach to prioritize validation and intentional scaling over rushing to market could help founders build more sustainable businesses. It‚Äôs about asking hard questions upfront‚Äîwould I invest in this idea if it weren‚Äôt mine? This mindset might not guarantee success, but it does help minimize blind spots that often lead to failure. This is such a powerful perspective! Adopting an investor mindset as a founder can really shift how ideas are evaluated. I think the key difference is stepping back and asking tough questions like:  

1. \*\*Market First, Product Second:\*\* Is the market big enough, and are people actively looking for a solution? Too many founders start with a product idea they love and \*then\* search for a market.  

2. \*\*Unit Economics:\*\* Would this idea make sense financially if it scaled? A lot of startups survive on hopes of future profitability but don‚Äôt validate the economics early on.  

3. \*\*Risk Assessment:\*\* As an investor, would you trust \*yourself\* to execute this? What are the bottlenecks that could kill it, and can you minimize them?  

4. \*\*Exit Strategy:\*\* Even if you don‚Äôt plan to sell, think like an investor‚Äîwhat‚Äôs the long-term growth potential?  

I‚Äôve personally tried framing ideas this way, and it helped me kill a few passion projects that weren‚Äôt scalable. It‚Äôs hard, but ultimately, it saves time and resources.  

Would love to hear if others have frameworks or tools they use to think this way. Maybe there‚Äôs room for something like a ‚ÄúFounder‚Äôs Due Diligence Checklist.‚Äù interesting perspective! approaching ideas with an investor mindset could definitely filter out less viable startups early on. have you tried applying tools like a 'pre-mortem' analysis or market sizing frameworks to assess ideas before jumping in? curious how founders could balance the passion for building with the practicality of investing i second that Thanks for sharing your perspective.",2025-01-09 23:50:47

Any tips?

Client acquisition might be tough, any ideas for marketing is appreciated. ","My general advice would be to do anything else. You're thinking about it because you're at schoola nd it's familiar. My advice is to get familiar with something else.

I've sold IT security systems / consulting into private schools here in Australia, and while the people I've dealt with have generally been pretty good to work with, selling into education is a bit of a nightmare. They have small, tightly-controlled budgets that everyone is trying to get a piece of.

Admissions might be a bit of a different story, because it's a sales/marketing cost - the benefit of getting students into a private school is that you generally have them for 12 years (depending on the entry year), and education is the last thing that parents still stop spending money on - you know an economy is really bad when private school enrolments start to drop off. Here in Perth everything is controlled by mineral prices (mining town), so in the last 15 years I've seen two instances where enrolments would drop by like 20% in a single year.

That all said... there are a couple of models I've seen work:

**1) International students.** These students pay much higher fees, and so any sort of community you can build to help people in foreign countries that are looking to send their kids to school in your country, majorly beneficial. For example, I met one person who was running courses to certify a potential students' english speaking ability, which they then used to feed them into a university program. I saw another guy who was doing community-based stuff for people from specific countries. I think he was Brazillian so he'd target Brazillian students that wanted to study in Australia - built a whole community around what to expect here, how to meet people, etc. etc. so that by the time they applied to study through him they were heavily invested.

**2) General student communities**. If you watch the ""Meet your class"" pitch in this episode of MFM, it's basically this model - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Feagizqd2M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Feagizqd2M) \- what they're doing is again building community with people to reduce the dropout rate.

Both of these are university-focused, so probably not as applicable, but should give you an idea of how they go about acquiring customers. Those business models are well-established so you can go and read amore about them.

**3) Ivy League Coaching**

I think the MFM guys had another edu consulting one where he'd basically worked out how to get kids into Harvard, and he had a programme he taught based around that. The appeal to parents was that he could pretty much lay out a formula that they could follow to increase their kid's chances of getting into their university of choice. I don't think it was Ivy Coach, but may have been. Anyway, private schools generally follow this model of promising future success if you send your kids there, so I'd look at both how they positioned and sold themselves and how they acquired customers. Board of directors of a few academic organizations, open your own non profit, invest and sell educational products, and finally leverage your networks to get students placements. It‚Äôs a whole industry and it‚Äôs not easy to break into.

The real question here is why private school. Parents have different answers to this one. Starting an educational consulting company is a great idea! Focus on building trust‚Äîoffer free workshops or webinars for parents on admissions tips. Leverage testimonials from students you‚Äôve helped and network with local schools. Social media ads targeting parents could also boost visibility. Good luck! The first 2 things you‚Äôve said are quite easy to achieve. Leveraging our parents networks also shouldn‚Äôt be too hard if we decide to use it as a marketing strategy.

Could you specify what you meant with the last sentence? We chose private school admissions since we‚Äôre all seniors at said private school(s) and recently got our uni admissions back, and 90% of us got into Ivy League institutions, which we believe could be a selling point. In comparison, most organizations have staff and leadership who‚Äôve only attended local/ community college. [deleted] For free ? No.",2025-01-09 20:33:40

Whatever you guys think can help me taking initial steps. 
 ","Find a problem that needs to be solved. This is the ideal way to approach business. Don‚Äôt chase the creative/ shiny ideas cause they may never work, demand is where problems are. I would start by talking to people in my circle to ask them what their main pain points are. And try to figure out how to solve one of those pain points, cause you‚Äôll have someone that can give you feedback once you have a first product/service. For mentorship, youtube is a goldmine, there‚Äôs a ton of podcasts/channels that discuss businesses every week, I like ‚Äúmy first million‚Äù and YouTube is really good at recommending similar content once you dive into a specific topic. Hope this helps!! Also I recommend the book The Lean Startup. It‚Äôs not as hard as you may imagine to start a business but some tricks can definitely help. 
Oh also, don‚Äôt try to start your business full time immediately if you don‚Äôt have to. Pick some side projects to get the gist of how people respond to it . Here‚Äôs the simplest advice:

1. Find a problem you care about solving.
2. Look for people who‚Äôd pay for the solution (that‚Äôs your market).
3. Start small and learn fast.

When we started Rocketdevs, we didn‚Äôt overthink it. We focused on connecting businesses with vetted developers because we knew that‚Äôs a huge pain point (also if you need devs that are well vetted, we have devs starting at th price of $8/hr).

Books like *The Lean Startup* or *Zero to One* can guide you. If you have an idea we could help. Feel free to DM us. No payment needed until it works I sell high ticket online self improvement and mental health products.

High ticket means a few sales a month = good income

I work 2 hours in the morning and 2 in the evening.

I'm averaging $10,000 per month

All you need is a phone and a laptop - work from anywhere

Its a 6 billion a year industy and not saturated like dropshipping, affiliate marketing etc.

Very good effort vs reward ratio and low investment - $3000 to get started

Plus I mentor others in doing the same so that is also rewarding

Whatever you choose do your due diligence. Working for yourself is extremely rewarding so go for it!

It might not be hard to start and i can definitely give my 100% but issue is what business model possible i can start... Well todays ppl seem like don‚Äôt have any major issues. I should ask business probably. Thats only thing i am missing actually..lack of idea.. Hmm i would like to know more about this.. What can you do? Message me if you want, I can give you a few tips on where to look Don‚Äôt get obsessed with business model. It‚Äôs the pain point identified and the solution you offer that matter the most then think about in what way (business model) should you offer that Just sit at a table with paper and a pen and start writing all the things that you need and, in a second list, all the things that you can do. Finally connect the first and second list and search for something that you need and you can create alone or with cofounders.

I would say focus on one thing and go all in, going vertical is easier and faster than trying to learn 3 things at the same time. For cars, I think if you can learn videography, shop owners or mechanics are always looking for people to help them make videos for social media since this is the new way to market. Investigation documentaries are big on youtube, this niche get good views and makes good money, there‚Äôs always writing opportunities around that niche, lookup the YouTube script writer subreddits, there is a few I believe. For web development I would say learn more about indie hacking, and shipping fast concept, look up those terms on twitter and you can find some great creators that talk about them.

From there, you can move to the following steps. Like getting a partner

If you want ‚Äúpassive income‚Äù or assets that appreciate, do something in real estate or buy long term equities. 

If you want a lifestyle business, find something you would love to do and see if there‚Äôs a market demand for it. 

If you want to change the world, go become a startup founder and look for an underserved, underrepresented, and underestimated problem and solve it in a unique way. 

The reason you‚Äôre having issues picking is because you haven‚Äôt decided what you want your life to look like. Too much freedom creates analysis paralysis. If you want to transform it, you must put in some constraints. 

Oh, and also do this process with your wife. Ask her what she wants your life together to look like and what she‚Äôll do to get there as your partner. I speak from painful experience here. Start a sandwich shop I run a fence and hardscape company, in my opinion start with marketing before going into details about the buisness. 

Learn how to run ads, like Google and Facebook. Those are what pays the bills and grows your company. 

You can spend years on a buisness idea but it‚Äôs not going to grow if you don‚Äôt know how to market. you could maybe look into getting leads for businesses in Upwork? people tend to pay good money for that and there‚Äôs a big demand for it.

also career growth in marketing can be both challenging and rewarding.

a few tips that have helped me: specialise in a niche area like content strategy or analytics to stand out, stay updated on trends (I watch a lot of YouTube videos to learn and read https://trends.co ($300/year) and https://theadvault.co.uk (free) religiously), and get comfortable with analytics, knowing how to measure and interpret results is key.

1) Do you prefer a business that will always heavily involve your active engagement or would you rather something that has the potential to transition to a passive income later on   
2) What do you have to invest in the beginning (this will be some combination of time, knowledge/skillset and money).  A brick and mortar or physical business tends to involve a lot more financial input at the beginning, whereas a marketing or digital product business tends to be much cheaper to start but will take just as much effort to get going.

Best of luck deciding on the best course of action for you and your wife! Deciding to make good use of your time is already a fantastic start! If I were you, I'd start content creation around your tourist area or rent out gear like bikes. You could also offer virtual assistant services, online courses, or start a pet service. There‚Äôs lots of potential for side income with your skills and location. Start with a small air bnb .. allow her to decorate and keep it stocked up and manage some of the booking stuff.. then scale ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Sounds like you just need to just do it. Take the leap. So what if it fails. What are you waiting for? What‚Äôs holding you back? It sounds like you‚Äôre in a great position to start something exciting! The combination of free time, a supportive partner, financial stability, and living in a tourist area gives you a lot of leverage. Here are a few ideas tailored to your situation:

1. **Leverage the Tourist Economy**: Since you're in a tourist area, you could create a business that caters to visitors. Some ideas:
   * **Guided Tours**: If you know your area well, offer unique walking, biking, or driving tours. Think historical, food-focused, or off-the-beaten-path adventures.
   * **Local Experiences**: Host workshops (e.g., cooking classes, crafts, or photography tours). Many tourists look for authentic experiences on platforms like Airbnb Experiences.
2. **Low-Capital Ecommerce**: With your sales skills, start a niche online store or dropshipping business. If there's a tourist-related niche (souvenirs, travel accessories, etc.), even better. Bonus: Your wife can handle product sourcing, shipping, or managing the store while you work on marketing.
3. **Use Your Idea Bank**: Go through the list of ideas you've written over the years and look for low-barrier, high-reward ones. Focus on ideas that can scale or turn into passive income over time.
4. **Content Creation**: Start a blog, YouTube channel, or TikTok about something you love or know well. Living in a tourist area gives you endless content possibilities‚Äîthink travel guides, reviews, or local stories. It‚Äôs a fun project, and your wife could help with filming, editing, or writing scripts.

Whatever you choose, make sure it aligns with your interests and skills so it feels exciting instead of overwhelming. And since your wife has time to help, find ways to make it a fun team effort!

What‚Äôs the most intriguing idea on your list so far? Pursue one of the ideas you already have‚Ä¶..    

Talk to your wife and discuss which of the too many ideas she would be interested in helping you achieve Start a family If you're looking to make the most of your free time, content creation seems like a natural fit. What about starting a YouTube channel focused on your local area. You could create guides, reviews, or even vlogs about the best places to eat, things to do, and hidden gems. Starting a YouTube channel as a content creator doesn't require any investment. Build yourself Just create a schedule and focus on it. Every time you fail gave yourself a punishment and the next day restart the schedule as nothing has happend. Punishment could be anything but not too unhealty (you CAN'T decide to not eat for a day as a punishment) nor too time wasting (it should be long enogh to be annoying but not more). You can also ask your wife to do the same and she will decide your punishment and you will decide hers. Having someone else than you will improve the results.

Good luck with your projects I'm pretty sure there's something in your list


Do an evaluation of each idea based on
1. feasibility, considering your current knowledge
2. demand on the market
3. how much people would spend (estimate)
4. how much you're passionate about the topic/project


Then pick the one with the highest score


Don't overlook the fourth one. If you don't like what you do, it won't last¬† if you'll search for those ideas you'll realise several of them have been implemented and are probably doing well.

so stop wasting any more time and start working on the best idea you can find from that list. OnlyFans whatever you do, cash flow it. most businesses fail in its first 2 years, and most of that is due to being in debt and lack of cash flow.


doing it in cash increases your probability of success insanely Ok, please don‚Äôt take offense to this, but you don‚Äôt come off as someone who is really ambitious. I mean if you‚Äôve spent 6 years writing down ideas and haven‚Äôt pulled the trigger on any of them, odds are, you may never take the leap! And that‚Äôs cool, it‚Äôs not for everyone. As someone who has been self employed my entire life, you need to be able to recognize an opportunity and strike while the iron is hot. Timing is everything. At your pace, even if you write down the greatest idea ever, by the time you get to it, someone else will have already done it. 

I could be wrong, I‚Äôm obviously basing this only on your post. But my best advice to someone like you is to get involved as an investor, not an owner/operator. Let the movers and shakers do all the heavy lifting and sit back and make money. This way, you‚Äôre part of something, but don‚Äôt need to be something you‚Äôre not! I sell high ticket online self improvement and mental health products.

High ticket means a few sales a month = good income

I work 2 hours in the morning and 2 in the evening.

I'm averaging $10,000 per month

All you need is a phone and a laptop - work from anywhere (even in your pajamas)

Its a 6 billion a year industy and not saturated like dropshipping, affiliate marketing etc.

Very good effort vs reward ratio and low investment - $3000 to get started

Plus I mentor others in doing the same so that is also rewarding

Whatever you choose to do make sure you check your due diligence. Working for yourself is hugely rewarding and you wont regret it! Solid advice! I second the wife part. 

As the househusband myself, it is important to understand the ambitions of two rather than the ambition of one. We could have a lot more going on that we do not burden you with.

Please never assume, always ask. Tempting! I love a good sandwich Wow that‚Äôs impressive? Are you open to any opportunities or is your plate full right now? Any recommendations on how to source leads? That's cool idea lol ü§£ How/where would I find one invest in? I'd imagine that isn't easy to achieve? I keep trying to think like this but ultimately I‚Äôm realising most of my ideas are just ‚Äònice to have‚Äô and not a ‚Äòmust have‚Äô so they won‚Äôt get to the scale I want them to Do you have more info on this are you still mentoring? Thanks! It‚Äôs been a long journey. I‚Äôm always open for opportunities - what did you have in mind? Depends on the niche. 

The Ad Vault has mentioned a couple of ads that are tailored for the B2B industry to source leads It really depends on the nonprofit.  Some need additional board members rather desperately but others can be a bit more selective.

Maybe you could start your own nonprofit.  If so what sort of work would you like to do? Please check out www.resetyourlife.online for more info Happy to talk more. Private message me for more if you like DM‚Äôing you",2025-01-09 17:38:36

I‚Äôm currently an IGCSE/A-Level student, and I want to integrate my interests into a business idea.

Main question: 

The main problem I have faced is finding the idea itself. I find it difficult to find an idea with true potential, since I‚Äôm not really professional at anything yet (as you might have already guessed). I also have trouble finding people who could potentially be interested in my idea.

My goal right now is no where near making money. I want to make a change, and make something useful. Money can come later.

I do believe there are a lot of pros of business in here that will hopefully help me out.

Thanks for taking the time to read this text and potentially respond! üôèüèª","You don‚Äôt come up with ideas to build a great business. Great businesses solve big problems.

Talk to as many people as possible and be curious. See what problems they face in their daily lives or work. Talk to more people and see if that problem is common and how much it costs them. This type of customer discovery will be so helpful if you want to build and sell a product.

Once you know the biggest problems people want to solve you can start thinking through viable ideas to solve it. You need to want it so badly that it keeps you up at night, and you‚Äôll feel unsettled until you find a way forward. If you reach that level of determination, you‚Äôll keep searching until you find what you‚Äôre looking for. Start by coming up with an idea, then figure out the skills required to make it happen. Remember, you can always hire experienced people on Fiverr or Wework to help, but stay realistic. Make sure to secure a job and save money so you can invest in hiring the right talent.

It‚Äôs also okay to fail. What matters is that you never give up. If you realize you‚Äôve given it your all and things still aren‚Äôt turning out the way you hoped, learn from it, and move on to a new idea. Keep going, again and again, until you achieve success. Persistence is key!! So you want somebody to give you a free idea instead of doing it their self? I see Honestly the best chance would be through starting a side-hustle! Once you get enough traction for the side-hustle, You could build this into a main-hustle. Unrelated, But if your ever in need of any graphical design help. I help business's with things such as logo development,3D product mockups and tend to other graphical needs. Drop me a DM if this is something your looking for. Well I‚Äôm disappointed that you looked at it negatively, but that was nowhere near my intentions.
I just needed help on how to come up with one. Nothing negative. But I don't understand what you expect unless an actual concept/idea.
Either sell one of your skill, but markets are saturated so it won't be easy, or think of a daily problem you have like an app/service that you tell yourself ""wish there was a way to do this"" or that already exists and that either could be improved or doesn't do it as you expected",2025-01-09 16:09:07
