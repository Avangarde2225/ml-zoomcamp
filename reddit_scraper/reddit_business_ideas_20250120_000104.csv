No paid courses, no groups, no bs. I‚Äôm working on my general store, I find it gives better a better chance for sales, rather than one product stores which are ‚Äúgambling‚Äù imo You could create two shops and see what works for you. Have a general store to sell whatever is trending and also create a niche store. I think a pet store primarily focused on dogs could do really well. You can always drop whatever doesn't work. Or gut it and try out different niches until you find a groove. Good luck!!",2025-01-19 18:57:39

Learn from your mistakes. Good luck. I would post the hell out of that north face coat on social media it is soooooo cute I would buy one right now if I had a dog I think your shop has so much potential, I would take away some stuff from your landing page so it's less busy. Also stop paying Zendrop, you can find plenty of pet products that go with your store using a free account with them. I'd give it more time, 12 sales in three months is nothing to scoff at in my opinionü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è good luck!! Yeah, close it Really I‚Äôm surprised you got 1 with this ugly color scheme. I closed it in 1 second. Your bounce rate must‚Äôve been god awful Please, as much as this helps their loved ones, the reviews are very fake. I saw it the second i read it. I thought so! But I appreciate your honesty, I will work on it. How are you marketing it? How are you getting sales? Words like ‚ÄúTop Grade‚Äù or ‚Äúpremium‚Äù are a turn-off. Bro your website is not that bad, i have been I to dropship since October 2024 and what I can tell is that you will have take more time learning marketing strategy, buy the product that you sell, do your own Creative, market it, learn SEO, learn algorithms of Meta and Google, Keep learning on the why üöÄ

Also very important, protect all your account with 2FA because in dropshipping there is a lot of Hacking on Facebook Meta business platform/ insta, Shopify etc protect everything, put a second person account to secure it too üîêüîêüîê INSTEAD OF CLOSING FOCUS ON IMPROVING YOUR PAGE .my ig is iwillgobylotsandlotsofnames I personally think it would not be a good idea to:
- start the first dropshipping store selling both dog and cat products at the same time
- import too many products to a store that is not UI/UX optimized
- selling many items under 20 USD without bundle deals or anything to increase AOV Can someone tell me what can I improve in my store? www.alunara369.store What's awful about it? It would be helpful to specify. Thank you I second this, a Northface dog coat could sell like hot cakes. Test different ad creatives on different socials and I bet one of them will hit for this product. I also think your domain name is clever, I hope you keep tryingüëè Thanksss.   Decided I kept on changing, I think this is the ugliest colour I have used Yes.  I will definitely try something else Well for starters it needs to work Is my webpage not opening for anyone? The black border around the cards is a bit much. On a whole it's really not that bad. Some good products in there, they seem reasonably priced and my wife would almost certainly buy half of it for our new puppy. 

OP, where are you advertising your site and on what social channels? If you do try something else in the future‚Äîthrow in the bin everything you think you know about ‚Äòdropshipping‚Äô and instead educate yourself on ‚Äòbusiness‚Äô next time. 

This store reeks of reading some dropbros ‚Äòfully sick dropshipping playbook‚Äô. And it commits alllllll the sins. Can you check again No It works and your store looks terrible. I can‚Äôt even look at it for too long. What are you? 13? Can you check it again Its for a young audience... But why? Good If you landed on this store would you buy anything from it?

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* I recommend using DSers with AliExpress and here's why
https://youtu.be/Ote0twG4Wlo?si=Zku7mCUeLi0bU-Nj

I've been using this setup for the past 4 years and truly believe it's the best setup for beginners

I have plenty of videos that goes through DSers and AliExpress so enjoy.

I always recommend reading Trustpilot reviews for companies you want to work with. Make sure to read their positive and negative reviews. If Youtubers recommend AutoDS, be sure it's either a sponsored video or the video description contains an affiliate link It depends on your needs. For dropshipping, Shopify is solid for ease of use and scalability. Tools like DSers or Spocket are great for product sourcing. Platforms like AutoDS are okay but can feel overwhelming or overhyped.

Avoid platforms with poor reviews or ones that overpromise quick results. You want something that helps you focus on building, not troubleshooting. Btw, if you want a ready-to-launch setup, check Ecomency ‚Äì they simplify everything. Just my 2 cents. I‚Äôm going to throw you a curveball. Drop this idea of being led to building a business around some shitty platform and first look to the market to come up with your business idea. Once you have an idea in mind, start looking into how you‚Äôll source your product/s. 

The dropshippers who are most likely to succeed aren‚Äôt going to be sourcing from these run of the mill platforms where a gazillion other ambitious bros are connected in and selling the same junk, the same way, to the same fatigued and wised-up customers. They‚Äôre going to be going to real and legit suppliers and distributors in their markets and teeing up real and legit relationships. 

I had an idea years ago to be the ‚Äòone stop shop‚Äô for all things hiking food. The store was to be content led‚Äîfood is an after thought for most hiking gear retailers and they don‚Äôt actively market it but it‚Äôs a product category that lends itself to content. Part of this was to sell dehydrators and food dehydration gear too. I reached out to all the top brands in that category and they loved the idea and wound be willing to dropship for me‚Äîthey already sell DTC so it‚Äôs easy to accomodate it. 

The moral of this story though is I had a defensible and competitive retail strategy. If I was some dopey bro who was like ‚ÄòI want to dropship your stuff and sell it with ads‚Äô I‚Äôm not offering up anything to drive incremental sales growth for them so they‚Äôd probably tell me to buzz off. Thanks!

I'm actually looking up your videos right now and think they're informative. But some steps feel like you're assuming the watcher already has prior knowledge like brand design or Photoshop. But I haven't dived deeper so maybe you actually have videos that teach these things or I could just learn them elsewhere which is also fine.

Nonetheless, I'll continue looking at your playlist since it's free and no links to any paid courses/communities so it's just a pure learning experience. IMO Spocket seems like it's just DSers with a better UI/UX. If it was free I'd use it but I don't see the price being justified. What do you like about it? What do you think of spytrends in comparison with spocket and dsers You're welcome, yeah in some videos I also forget to mention some points but it's because I mention them in other videos so I find myself having to repeat myself. I do have a video on some of the skills you should develop and ofc my 2 hour course which actually goes through branding and how to design everything from logo to the store to choosing colors etc.

But yes no paid groups or courses, everything free on my channel so enjoy! Glad you're getting through the playlist",2025-01-19 07:36:25

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* This is all about risk management. You could start on a ‚Äòhobby‚Äô basis and then formalise if you get traction but your government may take a dim view of this and you could get in trouble. Are you prepared to commit a federal crime, as minor as it may seem?

That all said, get your info from the OFFICIAL government sources on this. Don‚Äôt rely on some small-government ‚Äúthey can‚Äôt tell me what to do‚Äù bros on Reddit. 

Me, I don‚Äôt start half-assed businesses. If I‚Äôm going to start a business I do it properly. When I started my brand I registered a Pty Ltd company (the AU equivalent of an LLC) and did it properly. Here in AU if your business is forecast to do $75K over a 12 month period you need to register for and collect GST and file quarterly with the tax office. I ended up doing this from day-dot as after launch I was forecast to exceed this. 

I wasn‚Äôt setting out to throw spaghetti against the wall to see if it stuck; I was setting out to create a real business and that required formality and investment. You reap what you sow, as they say. You really should at least register as a business. In most countries it's cheap. You do not need to go through all of that at the beginning. I‚Äôm not sure of the ‚Äútechnical‚Äù correct answer but you‚Äôll be fine.

I would suggest going that route once you become profitable or are at least doing consistent revenue.

Shopify doesn‚Äôt take care of taxes. They can ~assist~ in some aspects but you‚Äôll still need a CPA (or however you typically file your taxes) Not at all, there is something which in legal terms is called ‚Äútaxing ceiling‚Äù which covers you (most of the time) and what it basically means is that it differentiates actual business apart from basic economical actions. 

To be even more specific, let‚Äôs take Ebay as an example. In most of the cases, you won‚Äôt even bother paying taxes for the items you sell there even tho legally, you are enterprising an economical action, but it is considered that it‚Äôs not a consistent revenue.

Hope that was clear! Oh ok! I think I understand now. But if I'm dropshipping it's not the same as reselling right? I'm selling new. Not the same, yeah.",2025-01-18 13:42:02

But from experience, I can launch a branded dropshipping store in like 4 days How successful was your store? Just shy of a $1M (AUD) in top-line over 4 years on a 50-60% GM. As a side hustle. Sold it last year‚ÄîI have a busy day job in e-commerce for a large retail business so the juggle became too much. Are you fully self taught? That‚Äôs awesome! Congratulations! I‚Äôm putting my head down and trying to research everything on marketing and e-commerce that I can. Which aspect of it is the most crucial? Im self teaching and want to avoid mistakes where I can but also learn what is the best method in practice, what to hone in on. And what you did sounds impressive, so any tips I can get. sorry to be one of those pests but access to real people who dont want to sell you courses is rare. Ish. When I was a teen I liked to sell stuff on eBay, fiddle around with blogs, and do affiliate marketing (when it wasn‚Äôt scammy AF‚Äîback then it simply mean putting ads on your site and getting a clip of the ticket). I then started my career in sales before moving into copywriting (I was a copywriter then editor of a popular blog for a retail business), then digital marketing (more retail, a little bit of DTC), then e-commerce (worked my way up to senior level e-comm leadership for a large global retail company). 

I did start a marketing degree early on but ditched it. I‚Äôm not a uni person. So, self-taught insofar as that‚Äôs how I broke into my professional career. But I have a strong background that led me to starting a business. 

Do I believe that ‚Äòanyone can start a success e-commerce business‚Äô? No. I think you have to have the right attitude, sufficient smarts, resilience, a get-shit-done and figure-shit-out attitude, and be willing to learn. Very few of the ‚Äòwhere I start?‚Äô types in groups like this will succeed if that‚Äôs their approach and attitude. Read:

My overall impression is that the amount of people that are fine with tax fraud, selling replicas/fakes etc is also going up, probably as a result of the same thing.  
Its always facinating when people get upset and really defensive about pointing out how their great money saving method is literally just crime.

There has always been lazy people, unprepared people etc, but they did not used to be (or atleast feel like they were) as large a portion of the overall community.

dropship,"starting), I‚Äôd love your honest feedback:"," make dropshipping more streamlined, especially for people who are just starting out or feel stuck spending too much time managing everything manually.

So, if you‚Äôre a dropshipper (or thinking about starting), I‚Äôd love your honest feedback:
**- Would this solve any pain points you currently have?**
**- Which feature sounds the most useful to you?**
**- Is there something you‚Äôd add or remove?**

I know how overwhelming it can be to juggle product research, managing ads, and setting up a store while trying to stay profitable, so I set out to create a tool that brings all of these tasks together.

Here‚Äôs what the app would include:
**- Trending Product Finder:** Discover trending and in-demand products with insights like search volume, seasonal trends, (powered by data similar to google trends). You can also import products directly to your Shopify store with SEO-optimized descriptions, titles, and images‚Äîall in one click.

**- Ad Creation Tool with Performance Tracking:** Generate ad campaigns for TikTok, Google Ads, and Facebook with optimized settings tailored for success. Plus, track your ad performance with a built-in dashboard and actionable insights to help improve your ROI.

**- Cross-Sell/Upsell Suggestions:** Get upsell/cross-sell recommendations for your products and how to bundle them to increase your average order value.

My goal is to make dropshipping more streamlined, especially for people who are just starting out or feel stuck spending too much time managing everything manually.

So, if you‚Äôre a dropshipper (or thinking about starting), I‚Äôd love your honest feedback:
**- Would this solve any pain points you currently have?**
**- Which feature sounds the most useful to you?**
**- Is there something you‚Äôd add or remove?**

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* This is a solid idea! Managing product research, ads, and the store itself can be overwhelming, especially for those just starting out. Bringing everything into one app could really save a lot of time and energy. I especially like the concept of a trending product finder and the ad performance tracking‚Äîit sounds like it could make decision-making a lot easier for dropshippers.

A few questions I have:

* How will you ensure the trending product data stays relevant, especially with fast-changing market trends? Are you planning to update that feature frequently or incorporate real-time data?
* For the ad creation tool, will it be customizable, or will it mainly provide default settings based on the platform? Some flexibility could be helpful for different niches.
* Would the app be free to download and use? 

Also, the cross-sell/upsell feature sounds huge. How are you planning to integrate that with Shopify or other platforms? Is it going to be automated, or will users have to input specific recommendations?

I think this could be a game-changer for beginners who are overwhelmed by all the manual work. I‚Äôd be really interested to see how this evolves! It sounds awesome! What stage of creation are you in? First of all, I truly appreciate your feedback, it means a lot! Let me address your questions one by one:

1- Trending Products: The data will be similar to Google Trends, focusing on what products people are searching for weekly, combined with insights from social media trends. We‚Äôll be incorporating this both manually and through automation to ensure that the results are highly relevant and accurate. The automation will fetch trending product data while the manual aspect will help refine and verify the results for better precision.

2- Ad Creation Tool: The tool will generate optimized ad settings based on the product, target audience, and niche. You‚Äôll also have the flexibility to customize these settings according to your needs and preferences before creating and launching the ad directly from the app. This way, it‚Äôs not just automated, it‚Äôs adaptable to your strategy.

3- Pricing: The app will follow a freemium model, meaning some features will be free while others will require a subscription. That said, affordability is key to me, I want to make it accessible for everyone. The price point will likely max out at $25/month, but I‚Äôm still finalizing the details to make sure the value justifies the cost.

4- Cross-Sell/Upsell Tool: This feature will allow you to pick a product from your store (or even one outside of it) and get cross-sell and upsell suggestions. You‚Äôll be able to import these suggestions directly to your store with optimized listings, tailored to whether they‚Äôre an upsell or cross-sell. I‚Äôm still refining how this feature will be fully implemented, but the goal is to make it as seamless as possible.

As for the development stage, he trending product feature and ad creation tool are nearly complete, I‚Äôm just finalizing the details. The cross-sell/upsell tool is next in line for development, and the landing page is already live. If you‚Äôre interested, you can sign up for the waitlist to be part of the beta testing phase

Again thanks alot for your feedback! Yeah, this sounds really cool! :)",2025-01-15 09:16:53

Can‚Äôt speak on META ads because i have never used them but if you let the algorithm learn a bit more it will probably yield better results A 4-day data sample is actually not quite enough for Facebook Ads, as the LEARNING phase of Facebook Ads requires roughly 50 conversions, after which the ad results will be smoother and stable. If your scale up for now, the odds are less than ideal.

Also, I don't know what type of ad account you are using, but generally credit card account ads run for about 7 days and will start boosting. So it is recommended that you do two main attempts during this period, 1) make more selections along the products that you are now testing with results, and 2) try to open a new ad account to do more test if you desperate for testing, lol Good stuff dude, honestly you can't do much with the ads but wait for the ad spend limit to increase. 

Here's a flowchart on how to test and scale
https://youtu.be/Ffs4tAQztxM?si=oScOjyIAWU9EYMO_

Here are all the rolls I played when dropshipping so you can get a few ideas on what to do 
https://youtu.be/4WW7uxTyDXE?si=IUgxFPs5gWhCCdfu

Create content for organic reach. Create blogs. Create automated flows. Create more ads creatives. Many different tasks to do. Add more products etc. Fantastic work, by the way, on getting your test campaign up and generating profits in only four days! Keep a close watch on this campaign, as its daily ad spend limit stands at 50 bucks, along with these considerations:

Find the highest-performing ad and audience, informing future planning decisions.

If possible, let loose with a secondary campaign that features fresh audiences or creatives.

Prepare further creatives so you can deploy them once you have budgetary decision points for scale.

Do not implement any more radical changes in a short span: let the current campaign run its course and prep for the scaling.

Hope this helps you Thank you! I have a few more creatives ready to go Im just waiting for my ad spend limit to increase before I start another campaign otherwise both campaigns are gonna be sharing the 50 dollars.",2025-01-13 23:48:14

https://youtu.be/_5evV83CS-4?si=3_osPInvVApycxD5

12 things I wish I knew before running ads
https://youtu.be/EoGY-mRdoY8?si=rEvdvJ9m7TRlbdJn

For many choosing the right fulfilment app as people tend to start with AutoDS because of all the YouTube gurus promoting it but it's actually a pretty bad app. Here's why
https://youtu.be/PSOkmzjmWRc?si=KdrLSYu42oYib_uP I wish I knew all the dropship platforms like Zendrop and Spocket are simply additional middlemen that are more of a scam than anything else. I would have succeeded faster by avoiding these suppliers. I wrote poor reviews about many of these platforms on my website Dropshipping Hustle. I should have stayed as far away as possible from Auto DS I shouldn‚Äôt have focus on meta ads only Most payment platforms do not allow you to run a dropshipping business or process transactions through them. How big of a cock I have Atleast half the industry makes their money selling beginners their course or bad information Sourcing and its importance would anyone care to share some knowledge about dropshipping? Any info is helpful for some someone that never done it.. This! And coming up with a worthwhile, sustainable, and compelling product idea and/or value proposition for your customer is the hard bit. You mean the actual operating a business part. Fulfillment of orders is the dropshipping bit of it.

‚ÄúIs drop shipping still profitable?‚Äù Thats how you can tell that someone doesn‚Äôt get it.  Is opening a business profitable? It can be. Is everyone profitable that opens a business? Not even close. 

It‚Äôs no different. It‚Äôs no get rich quick scheme. Most businesses are lucky to break even year 1. 

That said, I‚Äôm sure there are outliers out there like in every other aspect of life. It‚Äôs better to be lucky than good. Wow this is an amazing response. I was sitting here thinking of something - you nailed it Dropshipping from AE to eBay is not sustainable. You are one customer complaint away from getting flagged. Been there. I've heard the same thing. I've heard many youtubers saying they're essential, but normal people saying they're a scam. All that means is they pay youtubers to endorse them. I'm gonna stay away from them fs What suppliers should we use? Thank you sm, I was starting to wonder if I was missing out. Why is that? Can u tell me why? Like what dont u like abt the platform? yeah bro autoDS is the most scammy shit Do you also run ads on other platforms aswell or do you just do organic dropshipping? Covknmaxing They are not even in the dropshipping industry, they are course/affiliate marketers. Can you elaborate? Depends on the type of Dropshipping you're doing but if you're Dropshipping from China I use AliExpress but I only work with suppliers who I can utilise VIP links. I only use AE and nothing else.

Sell enough and then deal with the actual merchant on AE for discounts and packaging for your items. I run ads on other platforms what platform do you see the most success on? What platform is the best for you? I would say Google ads and classified Classified ads You also do Dropshipping? In local newspapers? Yes and I only run in Meta, I wanted to start running ads on Pinterest too but still not doing it üòÇ No Why are you not doing it What are you selling in your store ?

You need good product,  and know how to market it. But everything needs to look legit, basically he handles customer service,  returns, and etc. not with that attitude Yes, it is just saturated and you need to understand what you‚Äôre doing. But it will never not be profitable I started dropshipping on eBay last month and I've made a profit so yes it's still profitable. There‚Äôs always going to be product to source and sell that will be profitable, otherwise WalMart and Amazon would be broke. Sales will always be profitable. Absolutely Very very rarely This! 

Though, it looks like this is the one comment u/L7W- might have missed or glossed over! üò¨üòÇ

The tone of the question suggests the OP thinks of dropshipping as some sort of fleeting trend. The trend of selling junk through a junk website and hoping for riches has sailed‚Äîthough, it never really was much of a thing as the Lambo bros made out; they just wanted to sell courses. 

The real question here is ‚Äòcan you start a profitable _business_ in 2025?‚Äô The answer is of course yes. There‚Äôll be many great, profitable businesses started this year. But, equally, there‚Äôll be many that fail spectacularly and plunge their owners into all sorts of financial distress. Fair response üëçüèº Appreciate the comment How do you start?? I keep seeing this tik toks and insta reels but I‚Äôm just curious cause I wanna get into drop shipping i literally just started this week i made an instagram and tiktok account. my instagram account is getting good views for me just making it, my tiktok isn‚Äôt doing well, the algorithm isn‚Äôt picking up my content. do you have any tips on how to get your first sale? What products are you selling if you don‚Äôt mind me asking? 'A platform with less competition' what do you mean by that? Like platform to find products? Or platform to sell like shopify? thank you for the thought out response. i am selling right now on amazon but want to transition more to a dropshipping model. quick question- how would i coordinate sending property shipping info if they order two products from the store? would they get two separate packages ? From suits? Surely this isn‚Äôt sustainable? Was just a question bud, no need to get your knickers in a twist Slight contradiction there Drop shipping what if I may ask? Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôve read and even upvoted his comment! And not entirely sure where you‚Äôve got the idea I believe it‚Äôs a fleeting trend? It was just a genuine question on if drop shipping was still profitable considering how saturated it is. Yes, they get two packages. As long as you tell your customers it will be coming in two orders they're normally ok about it. Tell them your products are produced in different areas or you have multiple warehouses or something like that. why not? Everyone wears a suit. Also, he has his own niche where he targets African Americans and Orthodox jews. He makes a lot of sales from Google Ads, Organically, repeat customers, and from his mailing list. Not saying it in a bad way, but this question is literally daily in this subreddit and I respond with the same thing every opportunity I get, keeping it plain and simple Everything and anything! 

The key is to find winning/trending/in-demand products. Well you‚Äôre asking whether it‚Äôs profitable this year as opposed to last year or the year before. Sound businesses can be infinitely profitable. 

As for ‚Äòsaturation‚Äô‚Äîavoid it completely. Playing in the red ocean is only a good idea if you have a kick arse defensible competitive strategy (then, really, you‚Äôve moved back into the blue ocean) and you‚Äôre smarter, more flush with capital, more strategic, more well connected and experienced, and harder working than your competition. 

Remember, as the other bloke touched on, dropshipping is merely a distribution/inventory tactic. You‚Äôre creating a RETAIL business. i‚Äôm going to try to find a company in china who can package them together. ideally we want branded boxes also I just meant surely it isn‚Äôt sustainable as the average man will only have 1-3 suits, and unless they ruin them I can‚Äôt imagine them buying a new suit every other week. But that‚Äôs just my take on it ‚ÄòNot with that attitude‚Äô is implying you are saying it in a bad day, and if you‚Äôre fed up of seeing the question leave the subreddit, or simply don‚Äôt respond. Use your time better. Well of course, but if you compare 5 years ago to now, the percentage of ROI was definitely a lot higher than currently. Now what separates you from others is how unique your product is, the demand for it, how good your advertisement is, and how reliable you are. I am... not mad?  
Stop for a moment and see it as a wake up call, the moment you doubt something you're gonna fail miserably, I can get deeper into this but as I said, I'm keeping it plain and simple as community service and frankly I don't care if people dislike me for it If you clearly go out of your way to comment that on every post you see it would suggest that something in the back of your mind is clicking.. I don't see it as ""Ugh!, they're so stupid, always the same thing!"" but as ""damn, another one, lemme try to bring them to sense""  
What's clicking my mind is how pesimistic these posts are and not how it's spam, that's why I have the urge to comment that everytime I see one Hardly pessimistic and spam, when on every post related to this one, someone has a different idea or input on how to scale an online business or how to get started.

My question to you is could you do something that‚Äôs desirable and compelling to customers using a dropship distribution model? Understanding that in the fashion space you‚Äôre going to have a gazillion quality competitors who offer fast shipping and so on. 

Generally speaking, I don‚Äôt think dropshipping is wise for fashion. Unless you use it to compliment your core offering‚Äîe.g. you dropship a particular high ticket cashmere coat so you don‚Äôt have to outlay a heap of capital on something that accounts for 0.001% of your product sales mix. 

As a customer, I have the gazillion aforementioned competitors to choose from who are established and reputable and offer fast delivery. The only reason I‚Äôd shift from shopping with one of them is if you did something supremely distinctive or different or unique and I have no choice but to fold. Unless it's print on demand, I dont know how you could possibly dropship your own brand. Why not plan to ship yourself and order branded inventory? It seems like two separate business models you're trying to combine. We can offer small - batch clothing customization services. Let us know what kind of clothing you need. As for T - shirts, we have a wide variety of types. If this is on the dropshipping side you can perhaps get a manufaturer to create it exactly how you want it maybe on alibaba ( dont know about quality I just saw a video on it ) and their are other choices but this is for if you want to handle material and everything about how it looks .

If you want to just have a logo or a graphic you can go for Printify, Redbubble they make the shirts any you get a portion of the profit if they sell it on the website . By portion its up to you to charge. It's definitely possible to do! I currently run a Shopify store containing over 170+ uniquely designed POD (Print On Demand) products and have made over ¬£1.8K in sales and over ¬£700 in pure profit and I haven't spent a dime on ADs. As someone who has grown several clothing brands to 5+ figures monthly, I can tell you that clothing is fucking hard to sell, and the margins are thin, especially if you're starting with print on demand, which you are. 

I recommend starting with a product that solves a legitimate problem that a lot of people have. This is called Print on Demand‚Äî POD. It‚Äôs basically dropshipping for clothes, and other apparel items like mugs or keychains. There are definitely suppliers in China who will brand/design your clothes the way you want and loads of more mainstream services like Printify‚Äî which can be connected to Shopify. It‚Äôs up to you to figure out who you want your supplier(s) to be. Different people have different goals. 

Here is my advice to you. Do not spend a single cent in running any advertisements or anything outside of setup costs. When your site and social media presence is solid, have it reviewed here or somewhere else, and then run ads. 

Second piece of advice. Like I said, you need to have a social media presence. This goes to the larger point of, building a *brand*. Your designs might be absolutely amazing but if you don‚Äôt come across as a clothing brand no one will buy from you. Sites that don‚Äôt look professional can make sales but it won‚Äôt be consistent and usually it‚Äôs people who already have a following/audience somehow who are guaranteed sales. You as a brand need to act like any other online fashion retailer. You can do it all online and for free. Of course though if you spend money, you can order the items and either do your own photoshoots/videography or hire someone to help you with it. The actual pictures or stuff don‚Äôt have to be amazing but if the pictures show the real item, the authenticity will lead to sales. This. If you‚Äôre talking about creating graphic designs to go on a shirt and not designing the shirts themselves, this is a solid way to go. Do you design the graphics yourself? Where do you find suppliers to start a clothing brand Find something which solves problem and make style statement Literally everywhere haha clothes are on Aliexpress too! It really depends on your vision for your brand I would want to order from china because it‚Äôll be way cheaper. Do you have any recommendations? No, I don‚Äôt, sorry. I have looked into POD and my research has only taken me as far as the more ‚Äòlegit‚Äô suppliers such as Printify. 

But literally every brand sources from places like China, Bangladesh, India, etc. Even Printify sources their clothes from these places. 

It‚Äôll depend on your vision and resources to find a supplier. There are plenty of people on here who have fashion dropshipping sites and their clothes are from Chinese suppliers. But unfortunately they might not be succeeding because that is not the most important factor. Successful brands are ALWAYS changing their suppliers and even have multiple suppliers or entities in their manufacturing process. You cannot hinge your entire venture on the supplier. You‚Äôll always be able to find a source. So don‚Äôt worry about that part so much. 

What is your vision for your brand? Answer that first before answering the question of where you‚Äôll find the clothes.",2025-01-12 15:39:15

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* I haven't dropshipped jewelry, but you should try to have high profit margins, so when a customer wants to return something you can tell them to keep the product and refund them. Also make sure you have a great looking website, take note of what the competitions websites look like. As someone who designs and creates their own jewelry, I can tell you it‚Äôs a tough and saturated market. You definitely need to know your demographic and see what is trending. Jewelry that can be personalized is always hot. You also need to decide if you are selling low end or higher end pieces. Costume or Real. Boho or boho luxe? Minimalist or Statement. I suggest buying sample pieces of the items you may want selling, especially if your are sourcing from from China - way too many pictures are often misrepresented. There are also people who seem to not even be aware of the fact that the items they received are garbage metal alloys, and/or  plastic stones posing as gemstones (completely different cut, color, etc‚Ä¶). Or‚Ä¶. they don‚Äôt care, since their fake earrings cost $1.00. Know your metals and stones (if you are going with precious metals and semi-precious/precious stones. Targeted Ads are a must! Using your own photos are a plus as well. Highly descriptive info about the jewelry is extremely important, since people are allergic to certain metals and metal alloys. Include size options and actual size of jewelry, especially if you take the minimalist route. 
Even though the market is saturated, time, effort, and targeted ads can make all the difference. 
*I don‚Äôt have my glasses on, so I apologize for typos Most dropshippers use Aliexpress at the beginning for testing. After getting orders, some dropshippers will turn to sourcing agency or private agent for faster shipping and customized service. We own an agency in China for dropshippers based on membership. If you are interested, we are open to be reached out. Thank you for replying! 
Could you elaborate on the refund thing would work? Thanks a lot for the advice! 
Could you tell me more about how you create your own jewelry? If your profit margin is high enough and you're making successful sales. Like selling a $15 watch for $50 for example, you'd be able to afford letting your customers keep the items and refund them. Sometimes Amazon does this with some items",2025-01-12 14:12:40

Real cost of starting a dropshipping store
https://youtu.be/xRRiFdOAJSU?si=KgAuiNFPIkMZ8x-G

Can you start with no money
https://youtu.be/3VGTWJb5ZIk?si=bg4PvObZFbTWwMta 2 million dollars atleast Thank you all for replies Imo ‚Ç¨2-3k How much money do you need to start dropshipping? Let‚Äôs break it down.

First, you don‚Äôt need as much as you think‚Äîbut you need more than nothing. Starting a business is about resourcefulness, not resources. If you're tired of relying on your job for income, that‚Äôs a good motivator, but you need to shift your mindset from *'How little can I spend?'* to *'How smart can I invest?'*

Here‚Äôs the deal:

You‚Äôll need money for three main things:

* **Website and Hosting:** Around $30‚Äì50/month (think Shopify or WooCommerce).
* **Product Testing/Ads:** At least $500‚Äì1,000 to run ads and test products effectively.
* **Tools/Apps:** Another $50‚Äì100/month for automation tools, analytics, and email software.

If you‚Äôre working with less than $1,000, you‚Äôre in a tight spot, but it‚Äôs still possible. Focus on:

* **Organic Marketing**: Use TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts to drive traffic for free.
* **Validating Products**: Spend time researching before investing in paid ads.

The truth is, if you only have $200 or $300 to start, you‚Äôre better off stacking cash from your job and learning skills like marketing, sales, or content creation until you can invest. Dropshipping isn‚Äôt a lottery‚Äîit‚Äôs a business.

If you can get your head around that, the money will follow. Stop thinking about how much you need to start, and start thinking about how committed you are to seeing it through.

Thanks for info bro on the other hand, I should add that you can never be fully prepared (financially or mentally or in terms of skills, etc). the best advice I received about business is to just get started.

this is also the experience I gathered after helping over 630 dropshippers build their own brands as their private supplier. so the choice remains yours.

good luck! if he is still working, the question remains the same. just that he has an income. he doesn't need that much to sustain himself as he works on his ecommerce business.

in fact, with an income helps him quite a bit. no objection to that. some even started negative. it's a fair point.

I think OP is asking that because he is thinking of starting it on the right footing. that's a mature way of approaching business. what did you supply? We source the product you sell, customize your packaging and ship to your customers directly.

https://www.tiktok.com/@pocketdrifterz You can get a lot of the answers you want by searching on the internet, but you I'll give you my two cents.

When you're dropshipping, what you're actually doing is starting a business.  It's a good business to get into without much starting money, because you're not paying thousands of dollars to buy, store and ship products.  

Running a business is an endless process of solving problems, day after day after day.  And it's about continuously learning.

A good place to start is to make a list of the things you'll need, starting from most important.  

* An idea of what you want to sell
* A supplier that dropships these products
* A website to sell the products

Those are the tip of the iceberg.  I could probably do a list of 100 things you'll need, but the most important part of this is learning as you go.

One last piece of advice is to not let perfect be the enemy of good.  You should get to a point relatively soon where you know enough to launch your website. LAUNCH it.  It will likely suck, but something is better than nothing, and if you improve a little every day, eventually you'll be in a good place. 

Best of luck! thank you!",2025-01-11 09:00:29

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* At 18, you're in a golden spot. You've got time, energy, and (probably) fewer obligations than you‚Äôll have later in life. Here's the deal, though: businesses don‚Äôt fail because of the business model, they fail because people quit too soon or don‚Äôt execute properly**.** Dropshipping isn‚Äôt dead; bad execution is.

But let‚Äôs think about this logically. If you‚Äôre afraid of wasting time and money, it tells me two things:

1. You‚Äôre risk-averse (which is okay).
2. You‚Äôre looking for certainty in an uncertain game.

Here‚Äôs my advice:

1. **Learn Skills First** ‚Äì Dropshipping isn‚Äôt just about selling products; it‚Äôs about marketing, sourcing, branding, and scaling. These are universal skills. Whether you succeed or fail, you‚Äôre building skills that you can leverage in other ventures. So, start thinking, *'How can I use this to learn, even if it doesn‚Äôt work?'*
2. **Start Small** ‚Äì Don‚Äôt overinvest. Use low-cost tools, experiment with small ad budgets, and validate your product ideas. Think of it like paying for an education in entrepreneurship instead of a college class you‚Äôre not sure will apply.
3. **Play the Long Game** ‚Äì If you‚Äôre expecting massive success in 3-6 months, you‚Äôll quit when it doesn‚Äôt happen. Dropshipping is a stepping stone, not the final destination. It‚Äôs a way to test ideas and learn the ropes. You may move on to private label, branding, or even different industries entirely.
4. **Develop an Edge** ‚Äì Most people fail because they‚Äôre lazy. They copy-paste their way into mediocrity. If you‚Äôre willing to work harder, create better ads, and actually understand your customer, you‚Äôll outperform the average competitor.
5. **Reframe Your Fear** ‚Äì You‚Äôre worried about wasting time. But you‚Äôll waste *way more time* debating and hesitating than actually trying something and failing. The worst-case scenario is you spend a few months learning what doesn‚Äôt work‚Äîand that‚Äôs valuable.
6. **Check out this course** \- [Here is a free 7 day crash course](https://lp.dropshipxl.com/) about dropshipping that I have found to be super helpful. 

**It‚Äôs worth it, if you make it worth it.** Dropshipping won‚Äôt make you rich overnight, but it can teach you how to build a real business and help you figure out if entrepreneurship is for you. Focus on learning and taking action, and don‚Äôt overthink it. If you put in the work, it will pay off whether in dropshipping or something else. i‚Äôm 18 and just had my first store flop and let me tell you, it‚Äôs going to be a lot of workü§£ you‚Äôre most likely going to spend hours on multiple stores until you get a good product. that‚Äôs okay though, because once it hits its going to be great I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre gonna get the answers u expect asking a question like this On this sub lol Reframe what you‚Äôre doing. You want to start a BUSINESS. 

Is 2025 a good year to start a business? Sure, if it‚Äôs a good business that addresses a customer problem or services some sort of under-serviced demand. And you‚Äôre willing to learn and do hard work. 

Is 2025 a good year to start a pump-and-dump business that competes in the red ocean? Not really, but that‚Äôs never really been a good idea and most who have attempted it have failed. The time will pass regardless my friend

Do the inputs and learn as you go. It‚Äôs not a waste of time if you spend 5 years building something for it to ‚Äúfail‚Äù. You have gained 5 years experience and 5 years ahead of someone who never started anything I‚Äôll give it to you straight:
-It isnt dead, just start. Dont get stuck in analysis paralysis, dont get stuck in tutorial hell, dont get stuck ‚Äúlearning skills first‚Äù just start, you‚Äôll learn along the way, and you‚Äôll get better by doing. Your first store will probably fail, so look to go into that learning as much as possible about everything. Thats how you‚Äôll win.
Goodluck. It‚Äôs just like any other business. If you know how to do that, you can make dropshipping work. If not, practice, learn, fail, stop watching YouTube, and see how it goes. Doing is the best teacher Dropshipping is not an easy money scheme, selling dropshipping courses is, dropshipping is just starting a business without manufacturing, shipping, or holding onto goods yourself.  

You can do it for anything, like if starting a clothing brand you can dropship custom clothes until you're ready to ship yourself or swap to other suppliers and delivery methods.  Quality being bad or shipping being slow isn't a quality of dropshipping necessarily, thats more scammy people who don't intend to grow past that and are fine dealing with issues that come up with that. [https://pharaohfinds.com](https://pharaohfinds.com) The days of generic AliExpress products with long shipping times are kinda dead. The key now is finding a niche and branding like a pro. People don‚Äôt wanna buy random junk, they want cool, useful products that feel legit. Also, focus on building trust with your customers (good website, fast responses, clear shipping info). If you can get all that down, dropshipping can still be profitable. Just be ready to learn, adapt, and hustle. And hey, tools like ConvoSearch can help make sure your customers can easily find what they‚Äôre looking for on your site, which is clutch when you‚Äôre starting out. It will be a waste of money and you‚Äôll probably get nowhere with drop shipping or anything related to a Shopify store unless you have a unique product or a very profitable product that‚Äôs highly in demand. I know a lot of dropshipers who have succeeded and failed; when you ask out if you are starting dropshipping you are just trying to find reasons from others to convince yourself to start or quit. So what I'm trying to say is you have to look inside yourself instead of listening to the noisy voices on the internet. Dead internet theory. From fully human responses to semi human responses and then in a year or two, itll be completely AI generated Thanks so much for the advice This is great advice.  Thank you. honestly i think its just like grinding to get good at a game. first 10 hours ur a bot but if u chuck in hundreds of hours and u focus on learning ur guranteed to climb the skill ladder.",2025-01-09 12:05:08

I've just launched my very first drop-shipping store, and I'm excited to share my journey with you. My niche is pet supplies.

Here's the plan I've got so far:

**Marketing Strategy:**

\- Running Google Search campaigns with a daily budget of $10 for testing.

\- My goal is to achieve a conversion rate of >3%.

\- Total testing budget: $300 for this store.

\- Targeting regions: US, UK, Canada, Australia, and all European countries.

**Setup Status:**

\- Store is live and connected to domain

\- I've integrated Google Analytics and a Facebook Pixel for tracking already.

Now i'm currently optimizing the store by adding more images, after that I will begin the ads campaign

**Product Details:**

Selling price: \~**$118**

Product cost: \~**$40**

Shipping cost: \~**$9**

Revenue per sale: **\~$70**

After accounting for ads (assuming \~$30/sale), I'm aiming for $40 profit per sale. (I've experiences running meta ads but this time i let other friend running google ads for me so i don't know if this number is realistic)

This is my first attempt, so I know there's a lot to learn along the way. I'll keep updating the results.

Wish me luck! if you have tips for a beginner like me i'd love to hear.

**Update (8 Jan):**

* The campaign has gone live with a $10 daily budget.
* I've added the shipping cost to the pricing to offer free shipping. The selling price is now $129.9 + tax, which makes the total quite high. Since I'm just testing if I can sell the product, I've decided to set the price at $119.9 with free shipping. The profit per sale is now around $50. With an expected $20 ad cost per sale, the real profit I'll take home is about $30 per sale.

**Update (13 Jan):**  
I used a demonstration product featuring a video from YouTube, but unfortunately, it was reported for copyright violation, and the platform removed my product. Despite several back-and-forth conversations, I'm unable to sell that product anymore, which is quite frustrating.

Since it was the weekend, I couldn't take immediate action. Today, I searched for the same product on AliExpress and re-imported it to our store. The process is now complete, and I've relaunched the ad campaign.","**REPORT posts/comments if they are SPAM, self-promotion, or a store review/critique**

Good luck üëç What was the cost for you to start everything You're the reason for price surges, asshole. I read in a book that it might sound odd, but it actually works! $119.99 has a more appealing effect. Thank you for your suggestion! I'm not using Shopify but an alternative platform. While it's not as powerful as Shopify, it's a good starting point for now. It handles everything for me, including fulfillment, product returns, and all related tasks. you only need to focus on finding customers Write down all the aspects of a successful dropshipping store, and then treat each as a subject that needs extensive studying. I've seen some people achieve over a 6% conversion rate using just Google Search campaigns. I'm planning to test it by focusing solely on Google Search to compare its performance with Meta Ads right! it's all about taking action and learning as you go

btw, just updated the progress up to today. aliexpress i'd say the best way to learn is by running your own store. you‚Äôll pick up a lot along the way. I started by learning Meta Ads, which was a foundation. Setting up the store isn‚Äôt too difficult, and if you find it overwhelming, you can hire someone on Fiverr to help. The tricky part is optimizing your store, but that‚Äôs not critical in the very beginning. Focus on starting and improving as you go! just make creatives every day till u master them. make creatives for random products. I didn't use any spy tools out there. Instead, I found the niche by browsing Facebook to see what types of products were gaining attention. then double-checked the demand using Google Trends and Google Keyword Planner How's it going so far? I've saved your post as I want to do something similar. Following your journey and rooting for you! Dog supplies Everything exists for a reason, drop-shipping exists because it brings convenience to customers. If you don't like it, that‚Äôs fine Say that to every person in this sub Sorry, but the stupid zombies on social media are responsible if they can't lookup the stuff themselves and just immediately buy stuff like a consumer slave after seeing an ad. How are you keeping track or managing returns, theft, damage, and loss when shipping, and quality control?

Doesn‚Äôt the original company put their branding or business logo in or around the product?

Goodluck! Which platform is that? Can you share? Why dont you do both? Nice! Keep us updated how it goes, also share the link here if possible. bet thank you this has been the #1 advice i‚Äôve received fr. just gotta work on product research and creative skills the most Thank you for your answer, but I mean specifically the product you selected, what were you looking for and how did you decide it was the right product?

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* If you haven‚Äôt ran ads before you‚Äôre pretty much going to watch that money disappear. I personally would hop on Upwork and use that money to land a bit of consistent income + skills. $200 is fine to start BUT - if your ads don‚Äôt sell you won‚Äôt have more money for more ads. If you do sell something - you will break even (maybe even profit a few bucks) and still be sitting there waiting for payouts with nothing to do. So that‚Äôs why I say maybe focus on income first then dropship to supplement once you have something coming in. This is what did personally and it took over 9 months and 3+ clients before I could afford to start a store! Best of luck!! Time to test your hustle :) Well i guess we both share the same situation - planning to start drop shipping, $200 budget. 
Will share my experience so far.
Am beginning with tshirts. So the first hurdle was to look for supplier & am going with Qikink (ordered 2 shirts to check quality & satisfied)
secondly designs - in my quest to find great design i ended up getting scammed by one of those websites that apparently sell ""cool designs"" for a fair amount say under 500 (although they did send a file containing design but it was too far from being good) so started creating my own designs using PS with youtube tutorials. A hosting website - went with Shopify but turns out that i would have to shell out nearly 2k every month as subscription (am not even sure that i will make profit for the first 5 months or so) so maybe will go for a domain or will use social media for sometime. Ads is something that I haven't fully understood & i know if i run ads with fully understanding it my money is just gonna disappear.

https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLep-t3wpCPkWSJcyYiFsELQGLn-wzALvX&si=NAc1csVXnsJgwEXB 200 is too little for anything really. 
Unless you're using WordPress for your website and woo commerce, which I think is $15/yr.

Shopify costs me $39/mo and then ads are very costly too.

So I would say either save more, or do organic with WordPress. 

There's a huge learning curve for WordPress but with years of time left you'll have it. 

But if you're targeting Indian markets which is significantly cheaper the CPMs and CPCs are inexpensive compared to the US. Ads may be viable for you. 

Good luck tho! Curious to know how you would navigate these challenges. If you are going to dropship, do some research and figure out how to start Organic Dropshipping.

I'm 1.5k poorer after beginning, I don't drop ship I'm doing everything myself minus the sourcing so a little costlier. 

Pick some skills that you lack, and then work on them and sign yourself up on Upwork. 
Once you do that continue to practice by yourself. 

Just like you will need copywriting and product photography or web design or Photoshop for your store.
Work on these in your free time while having a gig up on Upwork, eventually someone would hire you there.

This HASN'T worked for me so far but I've gotten really good at Photoshop and CRO for my store. It will work I am sure. If it doesn't atleast you're an expert WORTH hiring, you won't need to hire a Photoshop expert or a copywriting expert.

On the other side if there's something else you can reliably generate capital on a steady pace keep it going.

I'm looking for a part time job but I've got exams and then I'm going to be moving through cities so a little hard for me.

Good things take time, if you don't have$50,000 in the bank to outsource things you will need to learn them yourself eventually. 
Can't run a $500 business with the expenses of a $50,000 business.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* saturated products that worked around this time last year or 2 years prior. just market it differently Search through all TikTok and fb ad library of what sells by searching fitness related keywords. Make a huge list. Check Google Trend for stability. Keep doing that until you kinda start knowing the market If the TikTok ban goes through there will be an eccomerce boom from the lack of TikTok shop Digital fitness bundles are huge right now- like selling a workout guide plus meal plan plus maybe a quick motivational video series. ppl love those all-in-one packages. Also consider Selldone to launch paywalls or sell virtual products (if you use Stripe), it supports that natively and is new to market.   
Test different niches (yoga for beginners, kettlebell workouts for busy moms, etc..) and double down on what sticks. Supplements always sell because most people just wanna see results and also do the minimum amount of work possible, if you can pair those with some workout from home stuff it seems like a good idea, I think your base will be women in their 30s-40s Gently used underwear. This is your business. Nobody is going to run it for you. If you‚Äôve done research and don‚Äôt know what to sell, maybe this isn‚Äôt for you? 

The success of this project is going rest on the quality of your product selection and retail proposition. This isn‚Äôt something you can just turn to Reddit to answer. If you are still not sure what to sell, I think hot items are a good choice. Different hot-selling products in different periods can be determined based on the 2025 e-commerce marketing calendar. Digital products are only profitable if you make your owns, kinda courses, apps, templates, books,... You are on Shopify and need to market organically?

What does that mean ? Hi!! Could you elaborate on ‚Äúmarket differently‚Äù or give an example of what that looks like If it‚Äôs saturated would the ads still be profitable? Thanks man, I‚Äôll look into these
Have a good day! How do you avoid lawsuits with supplements Great idea üòÅüëåüèº I kind of posted this knowing I wouldn‚Äôt get a full answer, everyone gatekeepers which I do not blame at all - you‚Äôll just be feeding competitors.

But for someone who hasn‚Äôt made a sale yet I‚Äôd like to to know what people have had success with etc 

Thanks for you‚Äôre comment :) Where can I find trending fitness products for free? Sorry I meant inorganic Unless you're them manufacturer most of the risk goes back to the supplier. Interesting response and read of my comment. 

I‚Äôm not trying to gatekeep at all. I like to think the quality, nuanced advice I‚Äôve given in subs like this over the years has helped create some great, sustainable business. More so than saying ‚Äòsell skipping ropes, bro‚Äô or ‚Äòcheck out my shitty winning product list, bro‚Äô ever could.

I don‚Äôt believe in giving a horse water, but leading it to drink. Click my profile, read through my gazillions of comments, get a feel for how I view and do e-commerce. You‚Äôll also learn the category I established a real brand in and how I went ideating and launching the brand. Social media But risk is the responsibility of the seller? Sorry I didn‚Äôt mean to come off as rude, I just meant that other people (not you) gatekeeping products is something I do understand.

And I really do thank you for you‚Äôre comment because I‚Äôd rather learn and do things myself than be given it without hard work :) Not necessarily. The risk is also the responsibility of the buyer. An adult is expected to do their own research of where supplements are made, where the ingredients are sourced, etc. 

If someone takes pills willy nilly from the internet wouldn‚Äôt you say that‚Äôs their fault, not the pill sellers fault? People are out there selling ‚ÄòBigfoots‚Äô fur‚Ä¶if it‚Äôs actually an allergen for someone who buys it, they can‚Äôt sue the seller of that item, it‚Äôs their stupid fault for buying such an item believing it‚Äôs real üòÇ I would just tell the customer to f*ck off. Nah, you‚Äôre fine.

Don‚Äôt worry about those ‚Äògatekeepers‚Äô. Copying them‚Äîif they even are having real success, as they‚Äôre probably not‚Äîisn‚Äôt going to help you. You‚Äôll just be descending into the red ocean. Lol this guy ahaha Thanks for you‚Äôre wisdom! I‚Äôll take this on board and keep you updated

How to filter out good and bad products
https://youtu.be/M1A0vTVFpRY?si=VQAehSUT997y8XVc

I would never start a fitness or beauty store due to how competitive the industry is. Rare for new products to come out that aren't saturated. Fitness and beauty are two different worlds Have you tried the Meta Ad Library? NGMI You can search for some free plug-ins on Google, which can help you analyze the value of the product. Or you can register for membership on some websites. Usually you can try it for free for a week. I recently searched for a website for TikTok product analysis, which can be tried for free. You will gain something if you search more. Do u guys even make any money with dropshipping like shopify store? I signed up for a course a year or so ago and they used helium 10 it‚Äôs a chrome extension. It lets you look at amazon products. You can see certain things and it‚Äôs supposed to help you find a good product. I am not sure but I believe they have a package that is very cheap so you could test it out. It was awesome to see and I think it would really help unfortunately I didn‚Äôt have the money to continue with the project. [removed] üëçüèº What should I focus on What is that can I get some more information on this ? Okay I‚Äôll look into it Is it better than auto ds? Both are a good niche What do you know more on? If you're a fitness freak then go in for that. Not Gonna Make It? Yeah but the problem is I am not finding a proper product for that You'll never find the perfect product man.

Imagine you sell a product that has TERRIBLE shipping and the product always arrives damages, but you didn‚Äôt order it or read the reviews to find out more. If you don't have the patience to wait for it to arrive nor the will to invest that much in your business, just forget it you've lost already lol That's not really what I want. Was just wondering if starting advertising before the product is delivered to you is even possible to make it faster. That product will probably take almost a month to be delivered so that's a big waste of time That's true! At least you need to see the sample images How did it go with the winning items? Steal TikTok/Meta ads, create stills, etc. Use Canva, Capcut, Eleven Labs, etc. Never said don't read reviews lmao. Your singular purchase experience will not mimic the next 5 persons' experiences.  Ordering from WA v. FL alone can be a different experience. Ordering 1 v 2 v bundling with a 3rd item can be a different experience. Etc etc. There are simply too many variables. If youre sourcing a single sample and it comes damaged / inoperable, you should have 100% detected that it was garbage based on the reviews, images, proposed functionality, etc. The only advantage I see to purchashing a sample is if you're interested in creating your own ad content OR the product is unproven/not reviewed BUT you're 95% certain you've found a unicorn (which is v unlikely, if not impossible, in today's climate). Idk‚Ä¶ my product arrived to me in a week lol. The fact that it‚Äôll take a month to be delivered should be less a concern for your own needs, and more a concern for what you‚Äôre going to subject your customers to. So you want to get sales when you've not even handled the product yet? 


Let's be honest...you want to turn a quick buck. Not the game for you. Launching in a couple of weeks so I‚Äôll let you know then Right What?? I was asking for any idea that I could use to already start promoting my tik tok, facebook or instagram. That's totally not wanting to get a quick buck.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* Most dropshippers use Aliexpress at the beginning for testing. After getting orders, some dropshippers will turn to sourcing agency or private agent for faster shipping and customized service. CJ is one of the agents. Thus far I'm not impressed with their Customer Service AT ALL. I had an Agent reach out from them but she just sends me generic messages asking what my niche is 4x!!! (Even after Ir explained). Also their Chat Window is hard to see if you're waiting in line or what. I did an RFQ 2 weeks ago & they still haven't got back to me...Conversely DSers are MUCH BETTER with Customer Support...Hands down. I'm not sure about the Shipping part yet though...CJ may be cheap & handy for importing Products but so not impressed with their ""Service"" & that's right at the get go too. Their Customer Service also struggle to understand basic direct questions so...that's just my experiences this far Works for some people. Not for others. We have many clients who were able to reach our MOQ of 30 daily orders before switching from CJ to us. DSers is a beloved one. CJ dropshipping tried to win me over with marketing but one day looking at it and I realized it‚Äôs all the same. They‚Äôre two programs pulling from the same website, so it just depends whose interface you prefer.

I found all my listings on AliExpress direct using their filters, then just added the URLs to the import list for DSers. You'll likely still have some kind of logistics and fulfillment issues with CJ but I think they're the best option if you don't want to use AliExpress. I have a review of CJ and other dropshipping platforms on my website Dropshipping Hustle if you're interested. Good luck Sucks, horrible experience. Ruined my business They're absolutely horrible, nothings ever their fault and they ignore any issues, until you start leaving reviews of them online, then they act If you need faster processing and shipping times, I think you can try working with an agent, which is more cost-effective than CJ. In the initial stage, will use AliExpress to quickly test the product, and when  reach a certain sales volume, will cooperate with agents. Here I would like to recommend qbsourcing, they have very good control over orders I was planning to do the same, however the quickest AliX shipping option available was Standard, which apparently takes 20-30 days

I‚Äôve heard CJ can do 5-14 days I agree with you

Their customer service seems kinda lost, and repeated ask the same, unnecessary questions without helping out with direct action All I mainly care about is a fast shipping time

I would directly order from AliX with standard shipping but it‚Äôs nearly a month time and not worth it

Some I‚Äôve talked to say that CJ averages 7-14 days I still want to buy from the AliExpress supplier, however I don‚Äôt want to use AliX‚Äôs shipping
Their quickest option, AliX standard, still takes 20-30 days

I‚Äôve heard CJ can source from the supplier and ship within 14 days, sometimes as quick as 3-4 days (from what I‚Äôve heard at least)

My main concern is just faster shipping, what do you recommend? What do you use for now? I‚Äôm buying directly from an AliExpress supplier, I just don‚Äôt like their 20-30 day shipping Please check PM Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but CJ dropship doesn‚Äôt do the shipping, the AliExpress seller does. CJ dropshipping just isolates those listings with the fastest times?

You can do the same with DSers, you just have to isolate those listings yourself. And I did it myself directly on AliExpress - by just checking off ‚Äúship from USA‚Äù I still use AliExpress and I find the shipping times aren't too bad outside of peak season. 

Once I start making consistent daily sales I request a VIP link which some suppliers will agree to. Then you can usually negotiate better shipping lines and faster processing times. Mina.. its not so popular but they do thousands and thousands of orders daily. They offer me cashflow solutions and a lot of free branding stuff like free branded shipping bags and invoices. And the prices are great since their warehouse is all AI.. less humans, less errors, cheaper cost",2024-12-17 21:16:50

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* Hey! I started 2-3 months ago and I‚Äôm already profitable. My advice would be to set aside a $1-2k budget. You‚Äôll need it for testing ads on Meta until you find a winning Ad. Organic strategies like going viral on TikTok are another option, but in my experience so far, they‚Äôre less reliable for consistent results. Just sharing what‚Äôs worked for me early on. I've gone through and done a few courses but this is the best overall course IMO. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqGNDT\_utao&t=58298s.

I personally spent around $1k before starting to be profitable. My buddy also started around the same time I did and he spent $500 on meta ads and didn't get a single sale. He's looking for another product to dropship now. Hey, my friend! Learning Shopify and dropshipping can be super easy. Here are some of the best ways to get started:  
  
Shopify has tons of awesome tutorials and courses on their website. You can learn all the basics there.  
  
There are also lots of online courses and videos on platforms like Udemy and YouTube. Lots of great free resources to check out.  
  
The best way is to just jump in and start your own Shopify store. You can begin with a free trial and add more as you go.  
  
As for how much money you need, you can start small - maybe around $500 to $1,000. That should cover the basics to get your store up and running.  
  
Once you start seeing success, you can reinvest your profits into marketing and scaling up. Lots of dropshippers invest $5,000 to $10,000 per month into growth.  
  
The key is to start small, learn as you go, and gradually scale your business. Let me know if you have any other questions By trying and failing and probably close to $2k depending on how skilled you are at it Don‚Äôt do it Learn the fundamentals by reading and watching videos and then you'll learn the most by actually attempting a Shopify dropshipping store. Be prepared you'll likely fail at first but don't let it deter you, everyone does with their first store.

I think you'll need a minimum of $500 but $2,000 would be preferred and give you a better chance of success.

I have a ton of free content on my website Dropshipping Hustle if you need some help. Practice with small budget. At the beginning, you can try organic to learn something and then paid ads and other marketing. Keep learning and improving. I think shopify official resources is enough, with Relevant Content I once read a comment here that went along the lines of,

""Dropshipping is like shooting and money is your bullets. The more bullets you have the better. With some luck you can definitely hit your target with one bullet or hit it eventually with a lot of bullets.""

The one thing I would add is that skills will also be your bullets.

If you keep throwing money at it, paying for a nice looking site, optimized SEO, lots of ads, branding, etc and keep doing that for many products, it would be hard not to succeed.

But that would cost... a lot.

You cut cost by learning the skills needed.

Designing a page is not out of this world difficult, but it can take time. There are free youtube courses for SEO that are hours long, they should give an idea about optimization. It is the same for copywriting, storytelling, social media, and management.

By bringing a lot of skill bullets, you do not have to bring as much dollar bullets.

You end only having to pay for ads and you make your ads convert more through copy and SEO.

TL;DR: If keep throwing money at it, chances are eventually something will stick. Or by learning the skills, you keep costs down. Spy on your dropshipping competitors, try to understand how they achieve success meaning how they find, market/promote winners, and try do reproduce the same by applying their method. how do people test so many products and i think i would rather learn on my own timing instead of spending on a course at the moment yk so just keep at it overtime you will get better consistency? Why not? got it thank you! what does ""branding"" means when we talking not about wearing shop? Bro screw most of these comments. Just take AliExpress pictures and post them on eBay buy downloading from AliExpress itself and try to make a decent description. (Here‚Äôs the hard part) you will have to post not one or two listings to test this out. You will have to potentially post hundreds (not to make one sale but to make multiple a week or a day.) it really is kind of a grind but it feels so good to actually accomplish it. Jordan's Library course is free and 18 hours in depth. You can skip the self-help stuff but I watched it since I like that type of content. I like that he covers everything you need to get started. 

From what I've seen from other people winning, the (1) ad and (2) product page are the two most important things in your success. Yessir once a store hits it gets usual sales and the better the execution the better you can scale the ads Also this is completely free until you make a sale i was actually doing that now on my own it just feels like it would work so don‚Äôt go the organic route? and yea i feel like that would be very informative should i go the organic route for now? It does I actually believe it or not started on Facebook marketplace and had to use a website called tracktaco.com to get fake usps, ups or FedEx tracking numbers because they wouldn‚Äôt accept AliExpress shipping The most effective way for you to build a long-term sustainable brand is by converting customers through paid ads. Meta is currently the best platform to be running paid ads on imo. 

Trying to get sales organically is very difficult since you have to rely on virality to sell your products and once the virality of your video dies down, so does your company. 

This dude preaches organic dropshipping by going viral on TikTok if you want to learn more. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWET-a9LMrk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWET-a9LMrk) Organic is terrible plus they‚Äôre shutting down Tiktok scale meta ads. Do split tests on different product pages made by ai Some item categories that have worked for me is night lights, belt buckles, and hats. Some products that sell good I just buy one to see it for myself and try to sell on marketplace which works for me. I actually am new to this and have upgraded to getting my second alibaba pallet so for 2 items I actually get them cheaper than AliExpress. It‚Äôs a journey that started from selling junk around my house and one day I actually just wanted to try it out and it worked. Progress is slow feeling but I do think back and realize I was selling junk for almost nothing back then and now I‚Äôm at a point where I need to make my business legal. yea i gotta good feeling about my stire im building maybe make my first sale any recommendations? I‚Äôm happy for you man least your trying I have showed my friends how to do it in person and they just don‚Äôt. üíØüéÜ KEEP UP THE WORK AND DONT GIVE UP UNTIL THAT SALE COME THROUGH. Then do the math on a money goal based off of amount of sales for your target. Don‚Äôt waste too much time on small fish but big fish might snap your line. Try to go medium Pagepilot or sumn that‚Äôs what I used initial stage how would you say your doing now store wise One winning store working on my second",2024-12-17 21:11:02

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* The product isn't great bro. Small selection and only one price point. 

I cant imagine a customer seeking out a belt specialist. Most are already loyal to a particular fashion brand. 

6 to 10 day shipping times wont do either. You'd be better off stocking 5 of each yourself and offering faster delivery. Try not to go for black/white theme , also your pictures are literally from your hand go on canva and remove background and add pictures to a better background or no background at all and ad product details You would probably be better off running meta ads. How many people on tiktok really need this product. This is without even looking at your product or your website to determine whether they‚Äôre ok or junk. 

You use TikTok right? Think about your behaviour on there for a second. Do you ever buy anything immediately after clicking an ad? Probably not. You‚Äôre on there for entertainment, you might click on the odd thing, and then you‚Äôre back to your entertainment, right? 

There‚Äôs a partial answer to your concern. Low conversion may stem from unclear messaging or navigation issues. Ensure your site loads fast, displays trust signals, and targets the right audience. Question: Do the visitors drop off on the product, cart, or checkout pages?

This basic info can give the best answer/pointer, so I can give you some of my insights (10+years in ecomm and web development) Save your money and Sell a different product bro. A product like this will be evergreen. When it comes to a belt like this, you will need to market it differently‚Äîin a professional sense. 

You will need to build a store solely dedicated towards the belt that looks very professional.

I would recommend you better optimize your text for mobile pages, you need to learn alliteration & word pairing, commonly used in copyrighting, for example ""Slim & Sleek""‚ÄîLike Apple for example, short and simple yet concise wording which will fit on Desktop and Mobile and register clearly to the consumer.

This product would better be fit for Instagram or Facebook, for something like this you cannot just throw together some videos and call it a day, you will need to consider Influencer Marketing and take your Content to the next level itself.

This product can definitely sell but you must realize when it comes to business everything comes down to marketing. >I cant imagine a customer seeking out a belt specialist. Most are already loyal to a particular fashion brand.

But.. but... Daniel Craig!!

And it's not just a belt!! It solves the age old problem of your shirt not staying tucked in during formal occasions or while leaping over rooftops chasing down a spy ala Bondstyle.

Seriously, I would imagine the market for such an item would be very, *very*, small. Two sales sounds pretty good. Market it toward the wedding crowds and big formal dressers, not for the average person and you might do better. Horrible advice.

Your way if thinking shows a small mind, do realize plenty of people wear cheap simple walmart belts (I've seen this first hand plenty of times)‚ÄîMost people do not stick to one belt ""specialist"" like it's Gucci or Louis Vuitton...

There are plenty of people to target with this product all it takes is the right understanding in business and marketing‚ÄîOP needs to think of a way to convert those who buy cheap unbranded belts to his belts so they feel they have ""a new home"", from here he can expand and contact manufacturers.

People like yourself move on too quickly and/or have shiny object syndrome, you cannot expect a product to work off the bat especially if you market it like all of your other products, everyone has a different ""goal"" with their Stores as well, some people are not looking to just go viral and get a quick $1k/day. i have 7-12 day shipping time and that works out for me fine. Thank you. So what do you suggest going forward? No, I haven‚Äôt got any abandoned checkouts yet. Daniel Craig's belt would have a quick release mechanism for the chicks. For the shipping times, OP should consider finding a way to reduce this as much as possible, once you reach $100-$200 in sales (rev) from your product you should begin considering ordering inventory of that product (your best selling one) and begin selling it directly to the consumer ‚Äî From this point you want to begin branding and slowly shift out of the Dropshipping phase.

The guy wants to improve his conversion rate. Faster shipping would do that.

For customers, slow shipping means slow returns and even slower refunds if things go wrong. You need to look at it from the customer's eyes. What do I suggest? 

1. Take in what I say in my comment and let that inform how you advertise on platforms like TT. 

2. Just looked at your website. Don‚Äôt rip off low-res images of Daniel Craig; put your product front and square and communicate to me in a nano second what it does and why I should give a shit; make it easy for me to buy as at the moment you don‚Äôt have a menu and I have to scroll beyond the image that‚Äôs probably made be bounce to find a CTA; buy your product and get some QUALITY product and lifestyle shots and videos‚Äîconsider taking a ‚Äòhome shopping‚Äô network approach to selling it; it‚Äôs not a luxury product. 

3. I found go on and on. But, look at how other single product/few SKU brands that solve problems have gone about communicating with their customer. You should mate - it optimizes your results in seconds. [CartBoss.io](http://CartBoss.io) \- just check it out, you wont regret it But if he doesn't get sales he's possibly losing all that money he spends on the belts depending on the return policy as well Yep.

You‚Äôre starting a BUSINESS and you need a BUSINESS bank account. The bank you use personally‚Äîset up with them at this early stage. 

Have you registered your business and so on? Go to Google and search ‚Äòhow to start a business in the UK‚Äô, go to the first website with .gov.uk in the domain, and follow the checklists. 

Sounds to me like you‚Äôre being asked for business registration info. 

There‚Äôs a trend in this group where people use terms like ‚Äòdropshipping‚Äô and ‚ÄòShopify‚Äô as though they‚Äôre business models or types. They‚Äôre not. One is a distribution model and the other is a software. You‚Äôre starting a BUSINESS that will be in the RETAIL industry. I use Tide. From the UK as well. If you're just starting out though I wouldn't suggest setting up a business or applying for business cards. Use personal cards first and set up as a sole trader.

I‚Äôd also incorporate somewhere with better tax rates/economic outlook personally. Mate open wise and stripe account and just the standard UK bank account you‚Äôll be fine! I use Monzo.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* I would not even have involved it in my plans of what market/items to focus on.

7k is almost nothing and you can expect that to drop significantly again as you rebrand it or start posting promotional videos.  
And still its not a given that anybody of that small group that is left is even interested in what you are promoting.

Finding a market and category to break into is hard enough as it is without limiting yourself to having to build it around a 10-15$ instagram account. Anyone still following you are people who don‚Äôt know who you are and don‚Äôt care to unfollow dead pages/people. If you start posting again and appear on their FYPs, yes there is chance they‚Äôll vibe with your post/ad and buy your product but likely what‚Äôll happen is a bunch of people will unfollow you. 

Even if you post exactly the same content as what you originally posted, you‚Äôll lose followers, because peoples tastes change‚Äî remember they‚Äôre not still following you in the hopes that‚Äôll they‚Äôll get that content again, it‚Äôs because they literally forgot you/to unfollow. 

So that being said, if you want to use this page for dropshipping, go ahead, whoever sticks around, will. As for how you do it, that‚Äôs totally up to you, marketing strategies are varied. You can follow the branding you started with, you can do something different, whatever‚Ä¶but make sure it makes sense with your brand/products. As long as the product is in the same niche. Otherwise start a new account. If I were to create a new account should I make a specific niche theme page or should I make it based on a product and try to get a viral video? I‚Äôve seen do both methods which do you think is more effective?",2024-12-12 09:50:18

https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLep-t3wpCPkWSJcyYiFsELQGLn-wzALvX&si=NAc1csVXnsJgwEXB This may not work as you think. It takes a lot to attract fashion customers and from my clients who do fast fashion in the 7 and 8 figures, their conversions struggle even with just fashion consumers alone. To attract people for decors and then have them come to the site to buy clothes and vice versa, it will take quite a bit of effort/trial and errors to perform. I highly suggest looking into your strategy a bit more. Can you explain why its too late to start a store for Christmas products? Is it because the pixel needs time to warm up or just how little time is left to milk such niche? Yeah, I know that I‚Äôm kidna late with the Christmas stuff, but I‚Äôm not expecting any real sales on them since I just started. Regarding the UX UI, what recommendations you have specifically? Thanks a lot I‚Äôm not planning on running a fast fashion brand. It is an actual high quality designer brand, that is run as a complete separate entity, because I‚Äôm not the only owner of it. And for me its really cost effective to sell it on the same website Christmas is 10 business days away. Shipping time takes around 5 to 10 business days and sometimes longer unless your suppliers are shipping locally then it's a risk to ship Christmas products now. This is also the period where I start scaling back campaigns. Will be making a video on this soon. 

Also by the time you test and find your winning ads and formula, it'll be too late. Just go on youtube and look up UX/UI for ecommerce tutorial or something along those lines From an operational stand point, I can understand your logic. From a marketing standpoint, it would still be tough. What you're describing sounds like an Anthropologie or Nordstrom, is that correct??",2024-12-11 11:05:22

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* I would not dropship clothing, I wrote an article about why it's a bad idea on my website ""Dropshipping Hustle"" if you want more info. 

Hobby niches are good because you're targeting passionate people. I also like pets and educational kids toys because I target women over 40 as they're big online spenders, especially when it comes to their pets and kids/Grandkids. Fashion is probably one of the hardest categories to get into, especially ESPECIALLY if you‚Äôre dropshipping‚Äîyou‚Äôre not creating anything new or interesting. 

If you‚Äôre serious about starting a worthwhile business look inward, figure out what you‚Äôre good at/passionate about and what are YOU best at selling, and use that as a way of starting your ideation. 

Me, I‚Äôm an avid hiker. Thus, it was a no brainer to do something in the hiking space. And I didn‚Äôt just go out and spin up a store filled with junk. I turned to the community and looked for a problem to solve/underserviced demand. Turned out that aligned with a bit of an itch I had. No niche will work for you. Sorry Go for pet products. People spend crazy money on their pets, and it's emotional buying. Start with a specific niche like dog toys or cat grooming. Find suppliers on platforms like Spocket or CJ Dropshipping; they usually have decent quality.

For free marketing, spam TikTok and Instagram. Post daily‚Äîshort videos showing the product in action, like a dog playing with a toy or a cat chilling with a grooming glove. Use trending sounds and hashtags. Interact with comments to boost engagement. Cheap products, viral content = potential goldmine. Those niches are huge , did you drill into sub niches? Are you a total douche bag?!  Nobody is giving up that information.  What has worked best for you? Interesting, I will take a look, thanks Let‚Äôs talk in private if that‚Äôs something you do.",2024-12-09 17:03:04

While I'm allowed to share product links, the company mainly focuses on wholesale PC sales, not individual components.

The only source of joy in her life is thinking about her grandkids.

A product like **customized holiday-themed envelopes** or **personalized money-gifting kits",opportunity,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropship/comments/1h8fklb/step_by_step_guide_to_get_a_succesful/,STEP BY STEP GUIDE TO GET A SUCCESFUL DROPSHIPPING STORE BEFORE THE NEW YEAR,"Hello The title says it all so let us just get to it.

Dropshipping isn't easy but it is way easier than working a job.

The main difficulty you guys face is you lack the ability to act without someone telling you what to do.

I CALL IT THE WORKER SYNDROME.

YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD WHAT TO DO YOUR WHOLE LIFE, AND YOU ARE SO AFRAID TO MAKE A MISTAKE THAT YOU DON'T USE YOUR CREATIVE ENERGY.

So, I won't try to fix that syndrome now we will leave that for another post but to begin here is a step by step guide for you to get  a succesful dropshipping store before the new year.

# WHAT TO EXPECT?

In this guide, you‚Äôll find **everything you need** to build your first successful dropshipping store **step by step**.

The success that you will recieve won't be out of this world.

IT IS SIMPLY TO PROVE TO YOU IT IS POSSIBLE AND EASY TO SETUP **A PROFITABLE BUSINESS.**

**So the goal is to get more than what you invested.**

STEP 1: **CHOOSING A PROFITABLE NICHE**

how to pick a profitable Niche?

EVERY NICHE IS PROFITABLE BUT WHAT YOU SHOULD AIM FOR IS TO GET INTO THE NICHE'S THAT ARE **UNDERSATURATED.**

Dropshipping is full of oversaturated niches where competition is brutal, and profits are razor-thin. These are the niches where **everyone and their cat** is running ads:

* Fitness gear
* Phone accessories
* Beauty products
* Pets
* Home decor
* Clothing

AND THE MOST OVERSATURATED NICHE: TRENDY SHITTY PRODUCTS.

AVOID ALL OF THESE NICHES AT ALL COSTS.

# WHERE YOU WIN: THE UNDERSATURATED NICHES

The real money is in the niches **no one is paying attention to yet**. These are markets that are less competitive but still have a strong, untapped demand.

  
**1. THE BOOMER MARKET**

The boomer market is selling to the people out of the bubble, who probably don't even know what dropshipping is.

This market is a goldmine because of the following simple facts

1. Boomers don't have ADHD so they don't need to be entertained.

Boomers just need the supply to their demand on the simplest products.

I know a individual who generated millions in the boomer market selling post envelopes to grandpas and grandmas.

The ads were the cheapest kind and the simplest kind (pictures of envelopes).

This is a window to selling the most basic products to the most basic people.

Your job in this market is to make the process of the supplying the demand as simple as possible.

and the potential is endless.

//

**STEP 2: HOW TO PICK A WINNING PRODUCT** 

 To pick the winning product in our chosen undersaturated niche we have to put ourselves in the shoes of the target customer in this niche.

Ask yourself:

1. **What problem does this customer face daily?**
   * Winning products solve specific problems or make life easier.
2. **What does this customer desire most?**
   * Products that bring convenience, joy, or comfort will always sell.
3. **What would make this product irresistible?**
   * Is it affordable? Unique? Easy to use? Products that hit all three are unstoppable.

  
so let me answer that question for the boomer market 

# 1. What Problem Does This Customer Face Daily?

**Problem:**  
Grandma dedicated her life to raising her kids, but now she finds herself in a nursing home feeling **lonely** and without a sense of purpose. The only source of joy in her life is thinking about her grandkids. She cherishes every opportunity to connect with them, especially during holidays or special occasions, but struggles to find meaningful ways to stay in touch.

**Solution:**  
Grandma loves sending money to her grandkids during holidays as a small token of her love. A product like **customized holiday-themed envelopes** or **personalized money-gifting kits** could help her feel connected to her grandkids, adding a thoughtful, heartfelt touch to every letter or gift she sends.

# What Problem Does This Customer Face Daily?

Grandma feels lonely and disconnected while living in a nursing home. She lacks a sense of purpose and deeply misses her grandkids, who are her only source of joy. She wants to connect with them regularly, especially during holidays, but struggles to make the gesture special and meaningful.

# What Does This Customer Desire Most?

Grandma desires a way to easily stay connected with her grandkids while expressing her love and care in a thoughtful way. She wants something that adds a personal, heartfelt touch when she sends money or letters on holidays and special occasions.

# What Would Make This Product Irresistible?

To make this product irresistible, it needs to be:

1. Affordable: Something that doesn‚Äôt strain Grandma‚Äôs budget.
2. Unique: Customized or themed envelopes that stand out, making her gifts feel special.
3. Easy to Use: Simple, ready-to-go designs that require little effort from Grandma, while adding joy for her grandkids.

# STEP 3: SETTING UP THE PERFECT STORE

Setting up the perfect store is one of the biggest challenges new dropshippers face. A big mistake beginners make is trying to build the store themselves. This not only adds to the learning curve but often results in poor design, which kills their chances of success.

**Solution:** Have a professional build the store for you.  
However, **your job** is to provide clear instructions so the store matches the needs and expectations of your **target customer**.

Here are the general questions you need to ask and answer to give your outsourced professional the best guidance:

^(Note: If you need help finding a outsourced professional who get the job done for you for a cheap price while maintaining the quality, I can help)

# Questions to Guide the Store Design

1. **What would make my target customer trust this store?**
   * **Answer:** Include trust-building elements like clear return policies, customer reviews, secure payment icons, and an easy-to-access ‚ÄúContact Us‚Äù page. Use a clean and organized layout to build confidence.
2. **What type of colors and design appeal to my target customer?**
   * **Answer:** Choose colors and a design style that resonate with your audience‚Äôs preferences. For example:
      * **Younger audiences**: Bold colors, modern visuals, and sleek designs.
      * **Older audiences**: Soft, calming colors and traditional layouts.
3. **How can I make the store feel like it‚Äôs built for my target customer?**
   * **Answer:** Use images, messaging, and product descriptions that speak directly to their desires or problems. Show visuals that reflect their lifestyle or needs.
4. **How do I make the product pages clear and easy to understand?**
   * **Answer:** Use simple language, large readable fonts, and clear bullet points to highlight product benefits. Include high-quality images, a video if possible, and a clear **Call-to-Action** like ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù or ‚ÄúBuy Now.‚Äù
5. **How do I reduce hesitation about buying online?**
   * **Answer:** Add trust indicators such as:
      * **Shipping details**: ‚ÄúFast and reliable shipping.‚Äù
      * **Guarantees**: ‚Äú30-day money-back guarantee.‚Äù
      * **Social proof**: Customer testimonials or reviews.
6. **What should my target customer experience when they visit the store for the first time?**
   * **Answer:** The store should feel inviting, easy to navigate, and tailored to their needs. The homepage should clearly showcase the product, highlight its benefits, and make it easy for them to take the next step.

# Example (Grandma):

If your target customer is **Grandma**, you might answer:

* Trust: Clean layout, big fonts, ‚Äúsafe and secure purchase‚Äù guarantee.
* Design: Soft, calming colors and relatable images of grandparents and grandkids.
* Experience: A welcoming homepage showing how the product solves her problem.



**STEP 5: CREATING A SIMPLE MARKETING STRATEGY**

Here is another place where most beginners in the dropshipping marketplace make a huge mistake. For me, running ads and targeting the right customer is incredibly simple‚Äîafter all, I am the smartest man alive (this whole post was just a sneaky way for me to flex, let‚Äôs be honest).

But what about you?  
You‚Äôve got two options:

1. Watch tutorials on how to target customers efficiently.
2. Hire an outsourced professional to set up your ad campaigns for cheap.

Whichever path you choose, the next step is all about understanding your target customer. Once again, we ask and answer the right questions to create ads that speak directly to them.

  
**Questions to Match Your Target Customer**

# Where does your target customer spend their time?



To market effectively, you need to know where your audience hangs out:

* Younger Customers: TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube.
* Older Audiences: Facebook, email marketing, or even Pinterest.
* Niche Communities: Reddit forums, hobbyist Facebook groups, or niche blogs.

For my case exampe: Grandma is most likely on facebook as that is the oldest social media platform.

# 2. What Would Make the Ad Grab Their Attention?

* Use visuals that reflect Grandma‚Äôs story and the product‚Äôs emotional value:
   * A smiling Grandma carefully placing money into a beautifully designed envelope.
   * Grandkids happily opening the letter, smiling, and hugging their gift.

**Ad Hook:**

* ‚ÄúGrandma‚Äôs Love Delivered: Make Every Holiday Gift Special üíå‚Äù

# 3. What Message Speaks Directly to Their Emotions?

For Grandma, the emotional hook is about connection and nostalgia. Frame the ad to emphasize love, family, and meaningful moments:

**Example Ad Copy:**  
*""Every letter from Grandma carries love, not just money. Our beautifully crafted gifting kits help her stay close to the grandkids who mean everything to her. Make this holiday unforgettable. üéÅ""*

**Why It Works:**

* This messaging tugs at the heartstrings, showing the product as a **bridge for connection** and love.

  
**4. What Kind of Offer Would Motivate Them to Buy?**

To reduce hesitation and drive sales, use simple incentives:

* **Free Shipping**: ‚ÄúFree delivery for orders placed this week!‚Äù
* **Limited-Time Holiday Discount**: ‚Äú20% off
* **Guarantee**: ‚Äú100% satisfaction guarantee





# AND THERE WE HAVE IT.

All it takes is **5 simple steps** to get your successful dropshipping store up and running.

**IT REALLY IS THAT SIMPLE.**

But then again‚Ä¶  
I‚Äôm not just the smartest man alive.  
I‚Äôm also the most humble, the greatest strategist, the king of execution, a visionary, a modern-day genius‚Ä¶ honestly, I‚Äôd keep going, but I don‚Äôt want to make the rest of you feel bad.

You‚Äôre welcome.

Get your Mini Projector now for only **¬£59.99 GBP** (taxes included) and uncover a world of entertainment! Hey, it's great that you want to start! Before making any ads, I would recommend checking out your competitors and looking for YouTube videos on how to properly set up and optimize a store. You‚Äôve got the basics down, like adding products, but now focus on how to further optimize and design your store. Don‚Äôt go online just yet‚Äîkeep building and refining everything. Good luck, you'll get there! üí™ The black-and-white color contrast on your homepage feels a bit unbalanced, with the black section between the white blocks appearing quite harsh. Also, there‚Äôs a lack of detailed product descriptions. The homepage‚Äôs structure could use some improvement as well (as suggested by others in the thread). I recommend focusing on systematically optimizing the UI layout first, then improving the visuals, and adding more informative content about your product to better guide potential customers. Need t&c page, tracking, faqs, reviews etc I think having the product details in a product page section rather than in homepage would do better. Homepage can be pictures of product and brief on what your product is and why buy. Here are my thoughts, instead of a one product store, have a bunch of products 10+, even if you don‚Äôt expect them to sell - this way when you run ads for that one product, your store comes across as more legitimate. At the moment you have one product page on a .org (get a .com or a localised .com.xx if you are selling to your own country in particular), a store logo/name that doesn‚Äôt match the web address, no links to support pages like shipping info/tracking, contact us, about us etc - this will all translate to no trust and ultimately no sales.

Here's how I found my POD dropshipping suppliers
https://youtu.be/4TgNcl1UUhk?si=kODXPBRZWFtJf52I We own a member-based agency named dseragent for dropshipping. We offer sourcing, fulfillment and pod customization for dropshippers. Our benefits are transparency, no mark-up, customer-oriented. If you have interests, please let me know. Printify and Printful are excellent starting points for print-on-demand. A private supplier could provide better margins, but start with these platforms to validate your idea before committing to private arrangements. I have personally used Printful for a year back a few years ago and it was pretty easy to work with. I was very satisfied with the quality and results. The option to buy a discounted sample product was very nice as well. Not sure if they still do that or not nowadays.",2024-12-03 14:58:47

Instead of setting $100 per day, my overtired brain decides $1 is the perfect number.

Did I double-check it? Of course not. I hit¬†*Save*¬†and passed out, dreaming of flawless ROAS and skyrocketing conversions.

Fast forward to the next morning:

* *Impressions:*¬†14.
* *Clicks:*¬†0.
* *Comments from the client:*¬†‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶is the campaign live?‚Äù

Cue my mini heart attack. I checked the dashboard, realized what I‚Äôd done, and quickly fixed it. But here‚Äôs where it gets weird those 14 impressions? One of them was from someone who DM‚Äôd the client about a bulk order.

Yup. A¬†*$1 budget*¬†somehow found the most qualified lead on the planet.

Now the client won‚Äôt stop asking, ‚ÄúCan we try the $1 strategy again?‚Äù And honestly? I‚Äôm just trying to pretend it was all part of my master plan.

Glad it worked out!! Always happy to read when things work out is a dollar is 14 impressions then $100 should be 1400 impressions noü§® Its true, i was the $1 dollar Same post 2 weeks ago? 14 impressions for a dollar isn't bad to be honest. Something something algorithm reset technique something something. That‚Äôs how I‚Äôd word it. I used to run $1000/day campaigns and sometimes I‚Äôd drop to $5 for a week and scale back and it‚Äôd work.

I'm like your client, when I find success and low ACOS for a day, I study the factors against other aspects of the campaign that were much less successful and I tweak away, dreaming of the perfect campaign set up.

Sadly, it's rarely a pattern you can replicate and almost always pure chance, people are unpredictable As someone who studied statistics‚Ä¶ for the love of GOD do not ever let them do the $1 campaign again ü§£ It seems luck is on your side, doesn't it? Um wasn't this posted in the PPC subreddit days ago? Nah bro got the dawg in him gotta charge extra for the $1 strategy man Haha, you‚Äôre absolutely right! The clickbait practically writes itself: ‚ÄúHow I Turned $1 Into Millions ‚Äì No Gimmicks, Just Pure Genius!‚Äù üòÇ There is something to be said about incentives on Google‚Äôs side for the PPC strategy.

My company invests $#K per month into Search Ads for one of our SKUs. CPC ~$12

I invest $300 per month into Search Ads for one of my side projects. CPC $0.10

If my side project CPC was $12, I‚Äôd no longer be a paying customer. And it‚Äôs a much worst idea than my company‚Äôs profitable SKU.

Busted. üòÇüòÇüòÇwait till he sees this Ladies and gentlemen we got em Ahahahah this made my day. :) Yup if the maf maths. The impressions appear as long as the click budget has not been exceeded. That means it appeared on 14 searches before somebody clicked the ad and exhausted the budget for the day. It could have gotten 1400 impressions that day if nobody clicked the ad before that number. You pay for clicks, not impressions. This shit just made me spit out my coffee Yeah, I remember this post, word for word. Pricing Facebook ads services often depends on factors like the scope of work, business goals, and the size of the ad spend. Here are a few common approaches I use

1. Flat Fee per month   
2. Percentage on ads spend usually 10 - 15%  
3. Sometimes a combination of both.

like the design though You should be doing a ton of research on products, your target ausdience, location of audience etc befor eyou even touch making a website.

There are many things I couldn't figure out and configure, so i had to brush some rust on my HTML, CSS, JS. yeah, I couldn't get to that point yet. I'm still working on SEO, content and products.
I want to test them all eventually.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* Garbage It looks just like a regular theme. 

What did your product build in 5 minutes ? Do you support abandoned cart recovery? Once i get the tool i can you use it to build unlimited stores ? Thank you for the question. It automatically sets up the entire store structure with all the elements that usually take hours to configure:

- Product page layout
- Homepage sections & layout
- Trust badges in strategic locations
- Social proof sections
- Optimized add-to-cart buttons
- Mobile-friendly navigation
- FAQ section

Basically saves you from spending days configuring everything manually. You just plug in your product and it's ready to sell. OneClickStore doesn't have built-in abandoned cart recovery, but you can integrate it with any Shopify app you're already using for that. It works seamlessly with all the popular apps out there. Yes, you can use it for multiple stores. It's a one-time payment and you can create as many stores as you want. No monthly fees or store limits. Most paid theme have all those pre built Yeah, but for abandoned cart recovery, you can always use [CartBoss.io](http://CartBoss.io) \- highly recommend you checking this solution out ;) We developed it, so if you have any questions, just let me know. Thats amazing. I'm buying it today. Does it support multiple languages ? Actually, standard themes are quite different. Regular paid themes:

- Come as templates you need to configure
- Require you to design and set up every section manually
- Often have too many options which can be overwhelming

With OneClickStore you don't need to make design decisions or spend hours in the theme customizer - it's already ready to go. Thanks for your interest!

I‚Äôm hoping to get some guidance on a business setup conundrum. I previously lived in India, where I ran a dropshipping business as a sole trader. Although the business is no longer active, I still retain the sole proprietorship in India. Now, I‚Äôve moved to the UK and am planning to start a new dropshipping business here.

My main questions are around the best structure for this. Should I use my existing Indian sole trader setup, or is it more practical (or necessary) to establish a new sole trader business in the UK? From a tax perspective, operating from India seems more favorable, but I‚Äôm concerned about the logistics, legality, and day-to-day management from the UK. I‚Äôm also unsure about the implications this setup might have with payment providers and platforms like Shopify.

So, I‚Äôd like to understand:
	1.	Can I legally use my Indian business while residing in the UK?
	2.	If it‚Äôs legally feasible, is it a practical or advisable approach?

Only if you fail to declare to the UK's HMRC any income from your Indian business => tax evasion

It's trivial to setup as a sole trader in the UK:  
[Register as a sole trader](https://www.gov.uk/become-sole-trader/register-sole-trader)

It's basically registering to pay tax via self assessment.

>So, I‚Äôd like to understand: 1. Can I legally use my Indian business while residing in the UK? 

Yes but you still have to register to pay tax in the UK.

>2. If it‚Äôs legally feasible, is it a practical or advisable approach

IMO, it would make things more complicated for you, in respect of tax, admin and currency exchange/transfer issues.  I'm unclear how VAT would be handled if you are trading in the UK from an Indian entity - perhaps others know. I'm new to all this drop shipping business so hoping to get as much knowledge and information as possible - lets say if I use AliExpress has my wholesaler, can I use platforms such Amazon and eBay to dropship and sell my products or would I need my own website? Thanks! From my experience, suppliers like working with LTD companies rather than sole traders. That‚Äôs what wanted to understand. I‚Äôm also leaning towards setting things here in the UK as the other setup makes things complicated for me.

Ok thanks for clearing things up. 
I‚Äôm not an expert, but I think you could go with either option, or even both, depending on your goals. Each approach has its pros and cons.

For example, with platforms like Amazon and eBay, you don‚Äôt need to worry about generating traffic, as they already attract a large audience. You might still need to invest in ads, but the traffic tends to be more qualified, as people visit these sites specifically to buy. The downside is that these platforms charge commissions, which can impact your profit margins.

On the other hand, with your own website, you‚Äôd need to handle marketing to drive traffic, but you wouldn‚Äôt have to pay any commission, allowing you to keep a larger share of each sale potentially.",2024-11-09 07:08:24

My personal experience - I‚Äôm in the process of a product that cost me $0.36 in raw material that I am planning on launching at $9.99 (which is low to subvert temu knockoffs) I think people will start looking for products out of China If it goes through (which most likely will not in full extent as China could impose the same on US and US has a lot of money from exports) all the platforms will simply start moving to Thailand or other countries from which they would ship, still taking advantage of the subsidized shipping rates and not being officially in China.

I still feel like I have a mountain to learn, but with what I've learned, if I don't make at least 6 figures next year, I'll consider it a failure. If you work hard, push through obstacles, and prioritize trying to always move forward, it will work. Depends on how much work you put into it. I think 90% or more will fail.

https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLep-t3wpCPkWSJcyYiFsELQGLn-wzALvX&si=NAc1csVXnsJgwEXB

I took on a subscriber and they managed to hit $10,000 in sales with 35% profit last week. It took them 6 months to get to where they were. You can find their results on my Instagram highlights. I started working on my idea about a month ago and there's so much to learn ahead.
Up until this point, I had to put myself in a different role to plan accordingly. My motivation has been a rollercoaster, but I haven't stopped working on it. Simply having a website is not enough. You need good content, marketing strategy, dealing with suppliers and the most critical of all - Do not stop believing in yourself im doing it since july and I managed to get my first sale a month ago, right now im on 10 sales barely breaking even You can hit 50k+ profits in a few months easily, just consume the correct content and test shit properly. Very difficult!  It‚Äôs business at the end of the day. dropshipping can be a grind. Margins are thin, and getting profitable means nailing down a solid niche, reliable suppliers, and killer marketing. Six figures is possible, but it‚Äôs a lot of testing, tweaking, and hustling to get there. No successful business is easy to run, so expect to spend a lot of time to make a dropshipping business successful. However, once you get it, it can go very far. I‚Äôve done close to 6 figures in a month, so it is definitely possible! You just need to do it the right way, and I‚Äôd also advise you to have a business partner. Another tip, see what your competitors are doing. Make use of Virgil Abloh‚Äôs  3% rule. Difficult. There has been at least 100 of these posts made in this sub in the past week. 

Based on your inability to research and lack of work ethic you have no chance at ever being successful as a entrepreneur and certainly not as a dropshipper. That is encouraging.  Thank you for your reply.  $60k in profit in 18 months is really good.  People who work jobs don‚Äôt often think about how hard it is to generate even $20 in income on your own. Are you constantly moving to a new product or have you found one product that is stable and profitable? How much time would you say you invested on average per week? Really ? I want to make the same too. Please help Good numbers, congrats! Did you start a branded product from the start? I‚Äôm not afraid of the work or of putting money into it.  I just wanted to see if it was real or if it was mostly social media hype for views. I‚Äôm always skeptical of people that create content claiming they know how to be super successful at something.  I figure that if they were really successful, they would be doing it instead of making content about it. Thank you for the information you provided.  This is encouraging. I guess the challenge is figuring out the correct content and figuring out how to hit your customer base with advertising so they know you‚Äôre there. How dare you say that?

E-commerce is only growing from year to year. We must stop seeing dropshipping as a business model. It‚Äôs e-commerce! And e-commerce is not dead and will never be.

You just have to stop believing that it‚Äôs easy... it‚Äôs a real job. I‚Äôve considered joining a network like Classic Computers, something that has a lot of domestic suppliers.  Subscriptions to such services can be pricey but might be worth it to keep a reliable supply chain.  My hesitation has come from not really knowing much about the products they can provide.  How important is knowledge of the product itself? That‚Äôs my concern.  I don‚Äôt know if I should just try to sell products that I think will make money or if I should try to build a brand of some kind. While testing things, I stumbled across one specific niche product which was very profitable. I then turned it into a collection of similar products. That has lead to long-term profitable stability. I still test, with products in my niche. But not enough, I'd like to do more testing. A lot of my time this year has been spend building brand and systems. That's a hard question to answer, as it fluctuated. At the beginning? As much as I possibly could, as I was obsessed. What do you need help with? Thanks. No, brand stuff came later.

- (5‚Äô) First, think of the ‚Äûvibe‚Äú your stores gives. 
Is it pet toys? Is it women‚Äòs clothing? Is it tech gadgets? 

- (15‚Äô) Second, think of the season.
Ex. What do people need in times where it is cold outside? What if your pet can‚Äòt go outside? etc.

- (3h) Third, Facebook Ad Library. This is research. Take it seriously. Attack this with the terms you‚Äòve found in the first and second phase.

- (^) Fourth, Check for the number of active ads
Minimum of 15-20 in the last 3 weeks.

- (2h) Fifth, Analyse the quality of the product pages for informational copy, features, benefits & unique buying reasons. Collect these.

- (^) Sixth, Google Lens Hunt for Visual Content.

- (1h) Seventh, talk with you supplier if they have something like this in stock. The products have to resemble as good as possible. Otherwise your After-Sale issues will make your life complicated.

- Final Step, If you have the OK from your supplier + you give yourself the OK to sell (think critically if this product could sell before you set up everything) 

then you have a new project!

Bon chance. Well, exactly what I am trying to get you guys some products suitable for dropshipping with proven demand.

You can take a look at my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dropship/comments/1gkak8u/i_made_a_bot_to_track_ecom_advertisers_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) to see if it can help you out. If there was a way, do you think it would be shared here? 

Learn your tools, do your research and have a business plan.

This has worked for the 5 successful businesses I‚Äôve had. I skimped on research on one business venture and it failed, the other failure was not having a business plan.

So 5 out of 7 isn‚Äôt bad. I have one active business now (number 7) and working out my marketing on my ecomm business (number 8); too early to tell if it‚Äôll sink or swim, but I did 6 months hard research and have a solid business plan in place. That's what i find the most challenging. 
And even if you find a segment, you need to think of a strategy. Just ads are not something a low budget can afford. You need to think of a way to pack and show the product from a different perspective.

I'm not an expert or something. I'm trying to launch a woocommerce website myself and start dropshipping. I just can't find a better way to show off my products to potential buyers. I know you have mentioned this in your post, but look at whats trending. Not on the surface level. At every video, come up with an idea. i am working on a store for this right now but ill let you in on a great idea. I keep on seeing brainrot so here is the idea i came up with.

Brainrot is trending right now. Skibidi, gyat, sigma, alpha. 

Dropship trophies of bums that say GYAT of the year 2024, with someones name on it. It is by far the silliest thing, and quite frankly a stupid thing, but these brainrot words are something Gen Z see daily and silly products like this can get a lot of impulse purchases, especially around christmas/black friday. We aren't in it together though...you're literally the competition. Out of interest, how are you searching for new products on TT?  What keywords are you using to search? how I do product research is first start with a niche, the dive deeper into the niche and find a sub niche, niche with in a niche, Then once I settle on the niche, i do a deep dive into the target market of said niche. your brand/store what ever is going to live and die by these folk so you need to know as much as you can. Chatgpt is really good for this kind of research. THEN i start to look for products. I use a combination of Google trends, google key word planner to help give me ideas of what my target market is searching for. I then hop on to amazon (I do not use amazon as a source) I start looking at the reviews. I then hop to AliExpress  and start looking for similar prices and i check to see how many have been sold and reviews. I also do a search online for my niche and suppliers. So say you want to start selling watches. I would do a google search for Watch (what ever type of watch your interested in selling)  dropship suppliers. And start looking though that list to see if they have products that my target market would be interested in selling.  

Remember its not about what YOU want or what YOU like, unless you are part of your target market. Its about what your target market wants.

Now another thing while I am on my soap box. Stop going with a broad audience when running ads.  That is a waste of money. Remember this not everyone is your customer. I will use myself as an example. I am a fat 48-year-old hairy pasty white man.  Lets say you are selling women's cocktail dresses. The kind with a slit all the way up to hip tight fitting body con style. And you decided to run a broad ad say 18 to 65 no interests. Well guess what your negative persona., me, gets to see your ad because the social media platform goes broad. Now say I accidently click on your ad, or out of curiosity i click on the ad. I have now wasted both your money as well as fucked up your data. Trust me no one wants to see my hairy ass in a black backless sexy number with my white leg that hasn't seen sun light in over 40 years sticking out!!  So before you start looking for products deep dive on your niche of choice THEN start looking for products.  have you tried poking around Reddit itself?  have you tried poking around Reddit itself?  have you tried poking around Reddit itself? Do some actual market research. If you're trying to sell popular tiki tok products, you're just one of the many in the same rat race. 

The game is price arbitrage, so you have to use your research and judgement to spot products that may sell well, aren't saturated in the market, and you can turn over for a good margin. 

There's no magic bullet, if there was, drop shipping would be even more saturated and overdone than it already is Get a shared account, pay $100 one time, no subscription and you have access to many product research tools like minea or Pipi ads adspy etc. 

Then just simply look for the best products in small regions in the last week. 

As for the shared account thing. I can help u get it. I know a guy good point I just scroll and like product ads that are run by dropshippers to get more of em

Or I usually just search up a tag like ‚ÄúTikTok made me buy it‚Äù then look at recent videos

But like I mentioned, the algorithm goes insane and starts giving me advertisements about random AI tools and softwares that will ‚Äúhelp me grow my business‚Äù Do the opposite to this.  Try searching using keywords related to particular niches you are interested in.  If you want products that are eco friendly, search it as an example.",2024-11-05 20:58:12

\* More active ads does not equal more sales, but I include only advertisers with 30+ ads, which should be enough to prove they are doing quite well.

Please [con",useful,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropship/comments/1gkak8u/i_made_a_bot_to_track_ecom_advertisers_on/,I made a bot to track e-com advertisers on Facebook that are spending big money. (Updates),"In the previous [version](https://www.reddit.com/r/dropship/comments/1eqawqc/i_made_a_bot_to_track_ecom_advertisers_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), it only returns winning advertisers who are placing many ads without further filter for products for dropshipping. That means you still need to spend quite some time to screen the products.

But now, on top of those winning advertisers, it can do background research and retrieve the products that are likely suitable for dropshipping, i.e. lightweight, small and solves a problem.

[Here](https://ibb.co/ZXXPdMw) is how it looks like.

# Sample E-commerce sites

Here are some samples of the winners you can have a look. (Please search the store yourself)

**Store name: GroundingWell**

Current active ads: 2500 in US

Summary by bot:¬† The website sells GroundingWell‚Ñ¢ Bedsheets and GroundingWell‚Ñ¢ Mats designed to provide grounding or earthing benefits for improved health and wellness during sleep and daily activities.

**Store name: Peak Footwear**

Current active ads: 400 in US

Summary by bot:¬† The website sells barefoot shoes designed for comfort and health, featuring good arch support, slip-resistant, and waterproof options for various seasons.

**Store name: ScalpHero**

Current active ads: 50 in US

Summary by bot: The website sells the HeroEpilator‚Ñ¢ Facial Hair Remover for painless facial hair removal and the ScalpHero‚Ñ¢ Smart Scalp Massager for promoting hair health and stress relief.

# My thoughts on using data:

\* You can just target similar audience to share the pie

\* You can target different audience in other ways to sell these proven products to more customers

\* Target to your own country in your local language

\* More active ads does not equal more sales, but I include only advertisers with 30+ ads, which should be enough to prove they are doing quite well.

Yup",success,concern,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropship/comments/1gictq1/how_much_budget_do_you_need_for_dropshipping_in/,How much budget do you need for dropshipping in India? ,"Finally after thinking and procrastinating a lot you decided to start dropshipping in India.¬†  
India is an emerging market. The big advantage is that it‚Äôs new for dropshipping. The competition is less.¬†  
This is the right time to start.¬†

But the biggest question that comes to your mind is how much budget you need for dropshipping in India.

Before I answer that you need to know in India there are two models of e-commerce.¬†  
1¬†. Inventory Model  
2¬†. Dropshipping Model

**Inventory Model**  
In the inventory Model, you keep the stock in your warehouse and you pack and ship it by yourself. You are responsible for stock management.¬†  
The advantage of this model is a high margin and more control.¬†  
The disadvantage is that it takes lot of work and effort and not everyone can do it.¬†

**Dropshipping Model**  
In this model, you receive the order from the customer and you place the order to dropshipping suppliers.¬†  
The advantage is you don‚Äôt have to manage the stock and shipping.  
The disadvantage is you don‚Äôt have control over delivery time and the margin is low.¬†

*Let‚Äôs get to the budget*

**Inventory Model**  
To test a product you buy it from suppliers first. Let‚Äôs say you buy 10 Pieces and each one can cost you around 100 to 300 rupees. You run Facebook ads for the same product which might cost you around 500 to 2000. So total cost can be from 2000 to 5000 just to test the product.¬†  
Assuming you test at least 10 products. before you find your first winner. It will cost you around 20k to 50k.¬†  
The story doesn‚Äôt end here. You also have to see if it is profitable in the long run. Because of RTO not every product is profitable.  
You have to repeat the process until you find a product that has less RTO and more profit.¬†  
Assuming you tested among 5 winning Products if it is profitable or not. You will have to spend roughly 1Lakh to 2.5 lakh.¬†  
However there is a way you don‚Äôt have buy products upfront while testing, that is the story for later.¬†

**Dropshipping Model**  
In this model, the majority of the money goes to Facebook ads. We will test a few products until we find a product we are getting good sales. We have to let it run and see if it is profitable. You have to at least 10k for a specific product in Facebook ads and calculate if it‚Äôs profitable or not.¬†  
The same process will repeat for at least 5 to 7 products.

Don‚Äôt forget the shopify subscription, your store will be active at least 5 months before you see profit. It can be less also.¬†

The budget you will need is 10k for shopify, 60k for Facebook ads (50k + 10k GST) and another 15k just find the product that is giving us sales.¬†  
The total is 85k is the minimum amount you need for the dropshipping model.¬†","**REPORT posts/comments if they are SPAM, self-promotion, or a store review/critique**

Go for it and you‚Äôll find out. Do you but, I personally think Its too late to ramp up a new store especially a seasonal one mid-Q4 of 2024.  
  
Think about the time it takes to finish your site, get your samples from overseas, shoot the ads, have all the accounts up and a fresh pixel warmed up for ur audience.

Also, your CPA will be high because of all the marketers spending this time of year raising the bid costs.  
  
I usually pause my store in early dec to make absolutely sure my customers get their gifts in time. Your shipping times will be too slow to get your product to your customer in time for Xmas.

Hope this helps brother üìàüìà I have some products you might be able to sell! Hey! Your plan for a seasonal gift shop sounds promising. Here are a few quick tips:

1. **Research**: Even if products aren't trending, ensure they have appeal. Use tools like Google Trends to gauge interest.
2. **TikTok Strategy**: Posting five TikToks daily is ambitious! Focus on engaging content that showcases product benefits.
3. **Product Quality**: Choose 10-15 high-quality items that resonate with your audience. Unique features can help them stand out.
4. **Website**: Ensure your site is user-friendly, mobile-optimized, and visually appealing. High-quality images and clear descriptions are key.
5. **Ads**: Use your Facebook ad experience to target the right audience effectively. Test different approaches to see what works best.

Stay adaptable and gather customer feedback after launch. Good luck!

  
If you need I can build you a FREE store, all I as it's a review in return. [removed] I was thinking about the exact same idea yesterday and i bumped into your post today. And I also have experience with running ads for my dad's business, but not really a dropshipping experience yet. Similarities in the story are insane. understood i believe in it 100% i have vision for it. my only concern is do i have be to safe and find trending products or be ambitious and find amazing products that r not trending really? i tried looking for stores with christmas products and there is barely any stores doing good right now simply because most of them are very low effort. i feel like i could right in i mean if i order some products by tonight they would be here in 7 days i guess then i can spend 5 days shooting content and post it the entire month of november and december. i‚Äôm trying to products with fairly quick shipping like 7-14 days isnt bad. yes im basically going to turn into a gift shop with new drops every week. but im also going to update its theme and stuff every season and add seasonal/ festive products dm Do you build them or do you just take what ChatGPT tells you.. lol Sorry, that's just so obviously written by ChatGPT it's just funny XD thank you so much that is what im going with. Forget about trending products. You can sell any products in November and December. Without asking you what you‚Äôre planing to sell I was just generalizing and pointing out the time crunch and hurdles to get up and running.

I just think it depends what your selling. People usually buy Christmas decorations early from a Home Depot or Walgreens, not online and not too close to Christmas.

And if ur thinking of selling a projector I would skip. Too saturated. You haven‚Äôt found any stores with Christmas products because it‚Äôs October most retailers don‚Äôt even put out their Christmas products until after thanksgiving Reddit says I can't for some reason lol thank you so much for that. i‚Äôm proceeding. not only christmas stuff of course like just all sort of seasonal stuff like winter gadgets such as fog lights, snow tools, warmers and then i can keep changing my products every season while also having a space for trending products in the market You ever leave your house? Good Lord, they had Christmas stuff in stores since October 10th. We just went for another box of treats for the kids coming by and there's not a single halloween thing left in the local grocery stores, and we went to all 4 lol It's all Christmas now lol. Been like that since like.. as long as I could walk by myself. I legitimately can't tell if this comment is a joke lol. 

That all said, I agree with most everyone here, a seasonal shop right now just isn't that smart. Unless you are an absolute marketing genius, you won't make enough money and then people will be complaining about late packages. But also, you do you. If this is what you want to do. Just do it. 

Don't come to this reddit group asking people. They will shut you down with negativity at every step of the way lol And why wouldn't they?

Your anecdotal Halloween candies are cute but still my point is that OP was too early because it was still Halloween. I‚Äôve spent the last decade in retail things may have changed but I‚Äôm confident on the timeline of rolling out new products It's not anecdotal. It's quite factual. Stores have had christmas stuff out since before Halloween. They always start christmas stuff like 2 weeks to three weeks before halloween is even over. I don't know what retail you've been in for 10 years. But in Canada, this is how it's always been. 

And EVERY year it's the same thing. People complaining about christmas stuff being out too early. Maybe it's different in the US then? But it's not here in Canada. That said, I do see you specifically said after Thanksgiving, so meaning the US for you, since Thanksgiving is usually around the 12th for Canadians.",2024-10-29 16:44:43

The biggest problem I see beginners face is they build a store, run ads and they either get no sales or little sales. Then they have no idea what the next step is. 

There are so many changes that can be made but they have no idea what change to make because they don't understand what the problem is.

It will require some patience and will be something you get better at with experience and every situation is different so there is no exact answer. The more unprofitable your store is the bigger the change you'll need to make.

I recommend using Shopify with DSers to automate your fulfilment process with AliExpress. It wasn't difficult for me to become profitable as I had built a branded niche dropshipping store. I was confident that I would make sales because of my products, niche, website and ad creatives. This was 4 years ago and I still run this store. This isn't really a direct answer to your question but I think I have the perfect solution for you.

You're just starting out on your journey and you probably lack the prerequisite skills needed to create killer marketing and advertising campaigns that drive sales like crazy.

I'm a freelance copywriter and I have the prerequisite skills needed to create killer marketing and advertising campaigns that drive sales like crazy. But I'm still trying to build a portfolio.

So why don't we just work together.

It's a win win situation.

You get a service that would normally cost you +/- $1000 monthly or would take you months to learn on your own. And you get it completely for free.

And I get the chance to build a portfolio and further improve my craft.

I'll worry about marketing, you'll worry about other functions of the business. And you get to reap all the benefits. All I want is the chance to build a portfolio.

In terms of the website, it does look pretty clean and layout is consistent. But I'd turn away as soon as I see the countdown. Imo it's too gimmicky. 

Also, definitely include an about us page and link to your socials. How do we know if the store is run by an actual person? Without socials, it looks to me like someone's going for a quick buck and run off. Honestly the website isn't THAT bad, but the reviews definitely are lol. Customers would not be mentioning your product with perfect grammar and branding in every review. The problem is most likely with your ads, not the landing page. 1. Show the product in action.
2. Remove fake reviews. You either need to create some unique images or use a Shopify app to disable right clicking because I seen your exact product on Amazon. A lot of customers price check and will do this and will impact your conversion rate. All your reviews are similar, even the 1 star reviews say the product is great? That'd make me back out of buying it **REPORT posts/comments if they are SPAM, self-promotion, or a store review/critique**

Is not a significant amount of money at all for running ads

>portable espress machine 

There‚Äôs also a typo on your second sub header

Your site looks okay, but a singular landing page in [modern day] is kind of lazy and your brand isn‚Äôt established so I‚Äôd just order off amazon 5 days for urgency? One of your images doesn‚Äôt properly appear‚Äîthe top is missing‚Äîand 2 of your 1-star reviews are really positive, which is a bit of a red flag to me. Overall, your site is pretty good if you ask me, but the reviews need to be fixed. A few more products and the ability to add upsells would also be a good idea, along with features to improve conversions, like email pop-ups for discounts, etc. Whats your product? This product has been beaten to death for about 10 years. This is NOT a good product. Out of how many sessions did you get 3 add to carts? Also I saw someone mention the countdown may be the problem, I personally don‚Äôt see anything wrong with it. I understand what they‚Äôre saying in terms of it being gimmicky but it doesn‚Äôt mean that it wouldn‚Äôt work. I use it and it works really well for me! How does one get so many reviews? Too many variables to say anything right now. 

Would you be open for a 20 min session I can get a better idea? This sub really is how to scam 101. Y'all are a cancer to society where is the video of it being used? For sure, I can start working on an actual about us page, but is connecting socials even if i'd have 0 followers a good idea? What do I do in that regard?

Second, I'll totally try removing the timer and seeing if that has an impact.

I just tried to copy paste my fb data and stuff and it didn't look right, and I tried to do an image and it doesn't let me lol Do I need to run more ads? Because I only use assets from my website in the ads and descriptions etc are all standard as it seems to me The one I see on amazon is more expensive, but I could be wrong or doing it wrong. Do you have an shopify apps that disable right-clicking that you would reccomend? And is there an app I can add to see if people actually do that? Totally understand, although I am undercutting 99% of things on amazon by a margin, could I ask what pages you'd suggest I add? 

Obviously an about us page, but other than that I wasn't sure what to add so I just ended up doing a single page. If I only have one product, should I have a different homepage and then this as a product page? Should the landing page go here or to the homepage? And what other pages should I include? Appreciate the feedback! I just wanted it to actually make sense, aligning with the end of October, but if that's not effective/it won't work I've tried removing it then I'll try adding a different, lower countdown :) Also I just checked your website, I‚Äôll have to say it looks great!! Looks like a genuine coffee company so congrats on that. Haven‚Äôt seen many websites on this sub where I can say they would get sales, but yours looks great! One thing is you can make your cart slide in from the right rather then landing the customer straight to the cart page. Also make the compare at price visible on the cart as well, you can use ‚ÄúCartly Slide Cart Drawer‚Äù for that. Another factor that you could improve on is making it a multiple product store all related to coffee. That way you don‚Äôt have to rely on having to sell one product but you can test out other ones as well. Based on what I‚Äôm seeing the problem is not fully the website, but I also need an answer to my previous question of how many sessions you have gotten. Agreed, countdown timers are an instant turn off.. of course they work on some but there are other ways to convey urgency.. looks like the countdown was gone when i visited your site üëå, which looked very good.. only suggestion i have is to move the reviews up above the FAQ's and about us paragraph. since socialproof is so important..  Whats your daily ad budget for an $80 product? How long have you ran Ads - was $100 spent over 7 days? I'm also new to paid ads - it took about 2 weeks before i got my first sale, with a daily budget per ad @ 20% of my products asking price \[$40\]. You need to be running video ads that showcase your products. Like send this to 5+ UGC creators who will make you lots of footage, b-roll, and whatever content you need to then make ads with. 

Image ads might work in some circumstances, but if you don't have video ads going right now you're trolling.

Standard isn't good, standard is bad. Your product, ads, and website need to stand out from other dropshippers, Amazon, etc. You want whoever sees your ad to think ""wow that's unique"" and then click through onto your website.

You also need some offer on your page, like a bundle or something. Check competitors. I didn't compare pricing but customers will and even if yours is cheaper than Amazon customers are familiar with Amazon and trust it and know they'll get fast shipping so they may prefer that even if it's more expensive. 

There are a ton of free Shopify apps that prevent right clicking they all do the same thing. There are expensive tools that can track your users activity on your site but that's probably not worth it for a new store.

I have a ton of free content on my website Dropshipping Hustle if you need help. Thank you so much for the advice! I'm just trying out removing the bar for a day or two to see how it works out, will def add a slide cart and I've wanted a way to show the discount in the cart as well. So I will totally do that. As for the sessions to cart, I now have 368 sessions with 3 add to carts. All my pixel data is scewed up though I might have to restart because more than half have been from reddit lol. For sure, I will check it out. I have no idea what UFC creators are though, and im not trying to troll but no I'm not running video ads üò≠üò≠ but my product has some great videos from manufacturer so I will add those.

I will for sure work on the creatives, but is there a way to pay someone not necessarily off Fiverr to make some for cheaper? I'm not looking to spend a lot but I could spend some as long as their reputable.

I'm planning to expand the store to multiple products but I've just had such a shit experience with dropshipping this is my 4th store (I've done 2 single product and 2 with more) and all of them have done 0 sales so I want to make sure the product is good before I expand, unless you believe it's essential (I just want to see some proof of concept dropshipping works)

https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLep-t3wpCPkWSJcyYiFsELQGLn-wzALvX&si=NAc1csVXnsJgwEXB Having multiple products and testing them is a good way to be able to find your winner. Just one is limited unless you have a really innovative and branded product. Niche store with products is preferred. They both have advantages and it really depends on the type of product or niche you're selling. I wrote an article on this exact subject if you're interested. [One vs multiple product store](https://www.dropshippinghustle.com/one-vs-multiple-products/) Unless your one-product is evergreen and caters to the masses, you will see sales drop off seasonally which isn't good for business.

But if you try out* multiple products in a defined niche, you have more headroom for experimenting and finding a winning product/products/category.

Also, if you want, we can get on a free consultation call to give you better insights. Selling one product in a store is a little bit risky. What if doesn't sell? You will have to redesign the store with new products and collections.

Since you have already found a niche that is Home Appliance and also found products in this niche, then a niche store would be a better option for you. It also gives you an opportunity to test various products in the same niche. Even doing branding of your store around that niche will be easier for you. I wouldn't invest in a one product store, but what about a one product campaign, wherein a landing page is dedicated to one product? I'd suggest going with a multi-product store, since your items are all in the home appliance niche. This approach gives you flexibility and can help with cross-selling, which often leads to higher average order values. Plus, if one product doesn‚Äôt resonate, you‚Äôve still got other options in the store to draw in customers.  I would list multiple products on your website because it builds credibility. A store with only 1-5 products is kind of sketchy looking in my opinion. Maybe aim for 10+ products on your store and advertise the one you think would do best. If it doesn't do well, you can still keep it on your store but just move on to the next product to actively advertise.

Just make sure the products make sense together. Home appliances is such a broad category so try to niche down as much as you can. Focus on a specific room in the house, vibe, age, gender, etc. To test I advise you to create a multiple products store. In fact i can help you create your dropshipping store for free.

I don't know where really to begin. 

Second is marketing. I understand that I gotta post videos daily at around the same time everyday and be consistent. My issue though is I don't have the money to just buy multiple products that are going to take 2-3 weeks to get here if not more, and I also have a cheap samsung that doesn't that doesnt have great video quality. Which means I need to scour the Internet and put a few videos together of my product and I'm not sure which video editing apps to go with. Finally someone doing good deeds for free. Does size matter?

The changes they did are great for dropshippers tho, there was nothing problematic about the updates. Western Europe is great but the problem is that there are a lot of individual markets and I prob","good, great, success","bad, problem, issue",,,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropship/comments/1ga5ohw/drop_shipping_is_probably_going_to_cooked_in_the/,Drop shipping is probably going to cooked in the next 6 months.,"Yesterday, I saw a video about some latest developments in dropshipping. It says that in the next 6 months it will not be legally and economically viable to dropship products from China to the US. It said that the De Minimis rule is getting scrapped. Here is how it said its gonna affect dropshipping. 

* From 6 months on from now sellers will have to pay customs duties but they also have to pay tariffs for every shipment no matter how small the packaging.
* As a dropshipper, you will have to reveal the buyer who is claiming the de minimis exemption and that means you have to give the buyer's social security number. When you dropship to US as a business, you need to give your EIN at the clearance. I personally do think no customer will want to give out their social security number considering the rising fraud cases in US. This is definitely going to kill dropshipping. 
* After the implementation of the law, you are required to submit the certificate of safety compliance at the port of entry or customs. I'm not sure if it must be done by Aliexpress or the dropshipper himself. 

What do you guys think about this development? Do you guys think dropshipping especially from China is cooked for ever. Experienced dropshippers plzz comment.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* Cooked, no chance!  More challenging, potentially.  This for me makes it more exciting, the tougher it is to trade in a particular market, the less competition.

If you think otherwise, business is not for you. This is one reason I drop ship from the USA. I filter aliexpress to show only ‚Äúship from USA‚Äù. It helps shipping times also. Their prices might go up but at least I‚Äôm not stuck with the customs details.

Also, FWIW, businesses change all the time, no matter the industry. What matters is how you respond/stay ahead. Dropshiping =/= dropshipping from china I doubt it'll happen and if it does there will always be a way around it. Part of me hopes it does because it will result in less competition and more opportunities. I think OP will open his mind more after positng this and seeing all these comments. Good news for Chinese sellers This is good news for me. I am setting up a 3PL company in Michigan.

This will allow people from outside of the United States to locate their products in my warehouse, and I will complete the shipping to the US customer from within the United States, which will avoid all of these restrictions. 

I‚Äôm basically competing with Amazon. Rather than a percentage, I am offering a flat rate for warehouse space. And a small additional charge on top of standard U.S. shipping.

So for me, this is very good news. I‚Äôm sorry for everybody else‚Äôs lost, but you‚Äôre going to have to find a way to logistically sidestep the restrictions and to look for loopholes. Curious too! Nobody that looks into the coming changes for both US and EU beyond surface level would really think its ""cooked"".

>I personally do think no customer will want to give out their social security number considering the rising fraud cases in US.

There is no need for them to give this out. Absolutely agree! I've been following this for the Sellify Club newsletter and almost every week, there's one thing or the other that puts the nail in the coffin of the dropshipping business model. 

\- First it was the EU's version of de minimis (150Euro threshold) being scrapped

\- Then the US legistlation

\- Then South Africa introduced a 20% VAT levy

\- Then TEMU posted 40% revenue growth, attracting IPO investors üòÖ

  
Would be interesting to see how it all plays out. Personally, I think the laws will curb dropshipping but like I've always said, true merchants will find a way to adapt. They will divest into 3PLs, print-on-demand industry  and source goods from places like Etsy like I've done in the past. For the 100,000,000,000 time, drop shipping is a logistics principle where a brand have contract with a supplier to ship units on demand without having to build up an inventory for the purpose of testing the market in the goal of finding a winning product to build a brand around it.

You can do dropshipping with US, Chinese, european, indian, middle eastern, african suppliers that are willing to do it the drop shipping way.

What many people fail to understand is that consumers are becoming more aware of dropshipping from china and they are extra careful when buying from websites or brands they‚Äôve never heard of.

If you sell them shitty quality don‚Äôt expect to build a great brand of it. it's just like the current Europe I am hoping this is to target big giants like Temu and Shein which is still using this loophole to make money. Usually when things get too big government notices and change rules to get a piece of the pie. 
Praying this is not to target small businesses. But like all the others say there is always a way around things, I‚Äôm sure we will adapt and so will the seller. Any YouTuber who says ""X is cooked!"" is an idiot...unless it's a cooking channel :)

As u/mmccccc correctly said, ""dropshipping"" is NOT the same thing as ""dropshipping using Chinese suppliers"". There's thousands of US-based suppliers you can get your products from, and there's many other countries from which you can get products from for your stores besides China.

The dropshipping model has been around since the days of Sears, Roebuck and Company, at least. It's not going anywhere. Don't believe the fearmongering BS. The winners will always find a way to win. US is not the only country you can dropship to... It's the hardest market anyway. Give a try to western Europe, you'll have more chance to succeed But I think this type of business model will still exist, that is, the economic model of drop shipping or one-piece delivery, because the market demand exists. In fact, I think even if you join a large platform similar to the Amazon FBA model, or the overseas warehouse model, it will still involve customs clearance and tariff issues. At present, the United States and the European Union have been reviewing Chinese export products in real time, but the sellers are still suffering. I think they will design a minimum sales volume to pay tariffs. It is impossible that a small package of 9.99 US dollars will also require you to pay a 2 US dollar import tax... Of course, if it really happens, I feel that it does not seem to be an abnormal event. Link to video please. PS: Now you only need to register IOSS or OSS in the name of your company to pay taxes, and you don‚Äôt need give the  EIN. Share the link please Is this in the UK or Europe? people who are upset about increased difficulty in a field are likely those who are at the bottom of the curve. U.S. is not the only country on earth where customers exist. SMH. This is always the common theme with newcomers. Haven't made a single sale and get all bogged down with future potential hazards. Focus on making 1 sale. Then 10. Then 100. Then 1,000. After THAT, if you want to think about doom and gloom then you're free to do so. But you wouldn't. Because you're so focused on your business, you ain't got time to think about all the negative stuff. So yeah.. stop worrying about all the problems in the game and figure out how to make your FIRST DOLLAR What if we ship it to ourselves first, as in you have your own little warehouse, and then ship it to the seller? I know that's not really dropshipping, but I was wondering if that was a potential way to circumvent these changes.

Also, is there a set date for when these changes are supposed to take place? This is only going to affect people dropshipping junk from China. People with real B2B deals won't be affected.

How I see this affecting the market is it is going to make e-commerce have a higher barrier of entry, but also improve the industry as a whole. People will either have to purchase their own product and vet its quality, or work with someone who has done QC for them. I would welcome both of these because it will make the e-commerce industry more lucrative and a better experience for customers. That is actually great news because this will immediately eliminate all of the low self-esteem guys who don't know how to make things work. You don't have to ship from China to dropship you just make more of a profit if you do. US 3PL? I don't think the USA will destroy a gold mine in tax revenue. Someone said prices will price 20-25% at least. If china has less business connection to us, it might provoke them to do dumb stuff as well. It‚Äôll just switch to more USA based dropshipping Incorrect The US (largest importer of goods) not being able to receive goods due to harsher regulations on receiving imports from china(largest exporter of goods) the worlds largest consumer is the united states even the largest corporations responsible for a percentage of our economy receive goods from china. 

Im curious do we think we will be self sufficient? are we assuming people other than ourselves personally will take care of these issues? The US never fails to make things way worse than they already are üòÇ One can only hope This will never happen, not sure why everyone arguing lol. Tell me you have no idea what dropshipping is without telling me Correct. When demand is UP that means business is GOOD. Like they are going to close millions of factories and ecommerce sites. What the government wants is A SLICE OF THAT PIE and they have tried for years and years. Of course you just have to find a way around the restrictions. That‚Äôs business. well said.

The changes they did are great for dropshippers tho, there was nothing problematic about the updates. Western Europe is great but the problem is that there are a lot of individual markets and I probably will have to redesign website and ad creatives that would cater to each one of them. I hope that I'm wrong. They might not have a problem closing those factories if they are Chinese. I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs the entire point. I made my own site, yes - and it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it could be a better performance üòÖ but what I said is still accurate üòÖ No 


I drop ship from US manufacturers. 

All the gurus have created this ideology that dropshipping only means buying products from Ali express‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt.

And china is only responsible for 15% of US imports, there is still the other 85% that nobody in this sub ever thinks about‚Ä¶ plenty of possibilities outside of Ali 

just need to get out of the echo chamber to realize these changes mean nothing. I'm in the egg stage of dropshipping, but I saw the same video and almost gave up before even starting, but the insight from the comments on this thread really give me back my peace of mind and hope I don‚Äôt really need to do that. One hundred customers would make me very happy. A lot of people don‚Äôt want to give up 30% of their sales just to participate with Amazon .

I know that I didn‚Äôt. You can store as many products as you can fit on the shelf for between $125 and $150 per month. I charge between two and three dollars over standard US shipping prices. Also, there is another aspect of competition where in some people just don‚Äôt like Amazon and don‚Äôt want to spend their dollars with them.

I am one of those people I‚Äôm curious about what market you‚Äôre in? All of what you mentioned is solved by sending packages bulksplit (like most already do to reduce costs).

Instead of sending lets say 500 packages from China to buyers in the US, its sent as one shipment into the US and then they split it up into 500 shipments after its imported.

This cuts costs/paperwork and they are getting it as a domestic shipment.

That way its the company importing it and not the person ordering it, and no need for their import information etc.  
Aliexpress like you mentioned already does this for most countries. So what? Clone and translate your current stores and ads, it's not that hard... I advise you to try targeting the Dutch market (NL & BE targeting Dutch speakers), or the Scandinavian market (NO, SE, FI). You just need to clone your initial store, translate (store and ads), put the right currency, and add the right payment options to each store (Ideal for Dutch and Klarna for Scandinavia). Good luck I really doubt you know the power of sales and the Chinese people XD. Makes no sense to have someone give their EIN or SSN: it is one of those ""laws"" that will never pass for being way too dumb. The US NEEDS Chinese goods since like 50000 years ago. Whoa‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure if I believe that. Gonna google wow, guys a random post got the most upvotes so far. appreciate the info. Maybe google before you comment? 

Google will tell you that the US imported 3.9T last year. 

600B was from china. 

That is about 15.3%.

Plus or minus a few % depending on the year.

Mexico is quickly catching up to china as companies move their manufacturing operations back to North America. Last year was the first year that china was not the #1 source of US imports‚Ä¶ Mexico claimed the title with 16%‚Ä¶ beating China by only a few tens of billions. 

Soon as the US punches a railroad through Mexico will be the new China. ""Maybe google before you comment"" lol calm down little guy, I wasn't attacking you. It was an interesting statement that I said I wasn't sure on and I was going to google for more info. Have you thought about many such ‚ÄúMexico co‚Äù are just shadow companies importing from China and then reselling into US? It only increases prices to the end consumers‚Ä¶lol ‚ÄúLittle guy‚Äù 

Lol, so you‚Äôre a child. All makes sense now.

I wasn‚Äôt attacking you either, you sure got riled up over it though Sure, some are.. that‚Äôs not the point though 

Are you disagreeing that companies are moving their manufacturing operations to Mexico? haha Like I said, I saw an interesting topic and I made a comment and you came off like a douche bag. I'm not riled up at all :) Have a great day and I hope you run into someone who can adjust that attitude for you some time. I‚Äôm sure that some are really moving factories to Mexico, but it sounds like you believe that it‚Äôs a major trend. Data can be misleading and many business flows are off the book. We can disagree and don‚Äôt have to persuade each other^_^ I came off like a douche bag? Ok bud. Whatever you say bud.

I didn‚Äôt insult you, you insulted me. Ie, you got riled up. 

Keep taking that T, it‚Äôs doing wonders for your temper. 
Nobody is importing 500b  into Mexico just to turn around and export it to the US. What an idiotic take.

Imports are public record. We know exactly how much product flows into and out the country, as well as its country of origin. How exactly is that ‚Äúmisleading‚Äù? 

(And before you say it, country of origin is defined as where the product is made, not which country the shipment originated from) 

I mean.. unless you‚Äôre suggesting the US Gov is lieing to us? . I‚Äôm not suggesting anything LOL
Not sure why you‚Äôre so emotionally arguing. 

With many years of experience in corporate data analysis, I learned that general data means nothing and drawing any generic conclusion from it ‚Äúcan be‚Äù misleading - I‚Äôm not saying ‚Äúis‚Äù. Data cannot lie but wrong analysis does happen more often than people think.

You used a generic import/export data to prove a ‚Äú manufacturing shift‚Äù - I don‚Äôt get it, not saying you are wrong but please tell me more. I always look at segmented data to ‚Äútry to‚Äù get the story.

What exactly industry segments or goods are we talking about? Electronics? Agriculture products? Clothes? And what are the major segments for e-commerce? Are those fast growing/exporting segments in Mexico matching those major e-commerce ones? What segments importing from China are declining or slowing down? Are these Chinese declining segments matching Mexico growing?

A simple test for me is to walk into any grocery store,  pick things up and check the labels. Do I see more things are made in Mexico than made in China? If so, i have no doubts you are right!

Too tired typing. I‚Äôm not going to respond to this thread any more. Thanks for the thought food. You wrote an essay about a whole lotta nothing. 

your argument is that the widely accepted consensus ‚Äúmight‚Äù be wrong??

Why don‚Äôt you argue global warming isn‚Äôt real while you‚Äôre at it. Numbers can be misleading after all.

While you‚Äôre at it, you should call up Union Pacific and tell them the trillions they spend expanding their rail lines from Mexico up to Canada was a waste and they are misinterpreting the data 

It‚Äôs all much more simple than you are making it out to be. Compare import records that originate from Mexico. Compare to import records that originate from China. Which number is bigger? Mexico? Looks like my comment is 100% correct. 

Again, there is no way to make that data ‚Äúsay something‚Äù. It‚Äôs not a complex conclusion and it‚Äôs not complex data.",2024-10-23 04:37:09

U got this üí™ üí™ Dropkeeping is the real deal bro I have a website called Dropshipping Hustle with a lot of free content from my own experiences with dropshipping. I also have an article about [how to do dropshipping if you're under 18](https://www.dropshippinghustle.com/dropshipping-if-youre-under-18/). Good luck. You can start totally free. As you say, you have lot of free time so keep research on Google & YouTube. Lot of sources, blog, videos are available on internet. You will get a better idea about dropshiping from there. Don't waste money at first. Good Luck!! I highly suggest building a following on social media first. I can help out, Dropshipping can actually help to get extra income that you can save up for that big dream. 

To start, I'd advise you do some research on products that would sell and its in high demand presently.. We can talk in DM if you don't mind what makes u say that? Love your stuff! [deleted] [deleted] i dont mind, thank you for your help Thank you, appreciate the love! clearly staged interaction Thank you for the vouch, glad you enjoy the videos and find them reliable!

Although I usually show figures and my ads manager in my videos. Just depends what the video is about. I wouldn't trust this guy btw.. new profile, not much karma and wants you to DM him. Dude. This guy is a scammer. Stop answering his DMs asap. Trust me. He‚Äôs BSing you completely you're welcome what stage are you presently? [deleted] [deleted] help him if you can, man. since you seem to know everyone here i know nothing about it or how to set anything up, all i know is that i can start whenever and it takes time. i did vet your comment history and found more references to ecomzone You're welcome. No offence taken üòé enjoy the free content The banana guy seems like a douche know it all as well. Just be careful, this subreddit is full of cancerous individuals trying to make a buck off of beginners. [removed] [deleted] He‚Äôs just not an idiot and recognizes a scammer when he sees one ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What do u mean in step 3. Drop ship the items to your store? the fact you got this defensive only proved my point Have you looked at his profile or any of his other posts?? There‚Äôs like 3-4 links for his YouTube videos. He‚Äôs directing traffic.

Maybe do a little looking around before you boot lick. Dropship the items means, after you've completed your research for Hot selling products, check Dropshipping Partner websites with Shopify, integrate them with Shopify and integrate these products into your store. It doesn't take much time. 

That's where you'll add your Profit Margin, etc [deleted] i understand your scepticism but I feel like he's one of the few legit ones. he runs his own store for 4 years showing consistent sales, if you don't like his youtube videos you dont need to watch them. thats more trustable than someone who shows fake sales then sells a 5k course imo. And you think that the other guy isn‚Äôt also trying to sell OP on something much scummier than a video? Smh man. Directing traffic to your videos is 10x less shady than trying to sell your bootleg Indian ‚Äúexpert‚Äù marketing services to people who don‚Äôt know better. yeah ur probably just arguing with an alt account of the banana guy. Reply to the top comment looked so staged you're just curating an air on being 'non biased' that's too careful. i'm not upset about it or anything just pointing it out Just put the fries in the bag lil bro üò≠üôè (jk) You sound like a Reddit Karen",2024-10-14 15:10:59

Hello everyone,

  
I'm planning to start my dropshipping e-shop. I know how to create a decent website, what products to sell but I don't know how to promote the e-shop.

I'm planning to start my dropshipping e-shop. I know how to create a decent website, what products to sell but I don't know how to promote the e-shop. My goal is to sell good quality products (no sh\*t from Aliexpress) from local manufacturers, which will serve the customer the best and the longest.   
  
I would like to create an honest business but I don't know much about marketing. Should I choose Google? or should I focus on social media (facebook, instagram, tiktok)? Thank you in advance to everyone who can give me some advice and especially to those who know that dropshipping is only a method to deliver the goods to customers and not something they can get rich quick.   
  
Also thank you all in advance for any advice and opinions, it will help me a lot. I would also like to point out that I DO NOT WANT TO BUY ANY COURSES so any attempts to sell these courses are pointless.

P.S. Please pardon my english, I am not a native speaker and i used a translator :,D.","**REPORT posts/comments if they are SPAM, self-promotion, or a store review/critique**

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/dropship) if you have any questions or concerns.* SEO works wonders in the long-term. You may need to scale with some knowledge and as much as you reject courses, you'd need to invest in some. Go to Udemy and start learning. Brand building takes a lot of technical knowledge. Good luck! You can still sell good quality products from China What is your budget? I know a direct sales company from China. If you can show me your online store, they can find the hot-selling products you want according to your needs and help you with the delivery without a minimum order quantity. The shipping time to mainstream countries in the world is 6-10 days, and they provide free removal of Chinese labels or logos.

I suggest AliExpress with DSers but if you want to find your own local manufacturers then that works too. Make sure you figure out shipping costs, moq, storage cost, etc.",2024-10-12 23:27:05
